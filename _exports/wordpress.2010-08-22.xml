		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you guys recall roughly a month ago, I <a href="http://www.redbluemagenta.com/2010/07/16/to-do-list/">drafted a todo list</a> that I've set out to conquer within a few months of making that post.  So far, I've accomplished only two things: hacking on Enki to get it to a state where I could actually deploy it, and setup Passenger and REE on my server so I could host Rails apps on my VPS.  However, I've totally fumbled on the rest of the todo list, and while I've pegged due dates on each of the items on that list, they weren't enough to actually get me to complete those items.

I don't consider myself particularly lazy, but I do tend to forget things pretty easily; I then remembered back to a piece of advice from <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596007836">Time Management for System Administrators</a> about always keeping an organizer or todo list on your person at all times; I figure that I always have my phone on me at all times, so having a todo list on my phone would work the best.  I also figured that a todo application that would work well for me would be one that was fairly "frictionless", reminded me when I needed to get things done by a specific due date, and could possibly email me alerts so I could always have something in front of me, whether I had my phone in my pocket or not.

I did find such an app (I think it's simply called "Todo" in the App Store).  I played around with <a href="http://getontracks.org/">Tracks</a>, which is a RoR project, and with writing stuff down on a pad of paper.  Neither worked; again, I personally needed the format of whatever application or medium to fit in my pocket, maybe on an already existing device (like my phone.)  A pad of paper is an extra item to carry around, and Tracks didn't format itself well for the phone.

		<title>Effectively administering a single server</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If we're stuck with only one server and assuming that our operating environment doesn't allow for any expansion (due to the software not able to scale up to an arbitrary set of physical computers or any other reason), we're caught in a trap; hardware always fails as time goes on, and overall system configuration degrades as well.  Usually we can mitigate this with automation, redundancy, etc.  But what if the service doesn't allow for redundant servers?  The best example are most first person shooter game servers: if the server goes down, even if we had a backup server ready to go on the same IP (in an active-passive HA setup), there's nothing in the server code (for the most part) that actually allows for player migration to another server; thus, we end up with the same result: all of the players are booted off of the server.

First step is to actually identify what we require of the service and what our expected outcome should be.

For our hypothetical game server, I'll use the following set of requirements:

<ol>
<li>We want to run a 32-player first person shooter server.</li>
<li>This service will be used by a community, which, on prior observation of other servers, usually provides enough of a server population to last at least 24 hours.</li>
<li>We want to be alerted when the service is either not running or is unresponsive.</li>
<li>Server files on the hard drive need to have the same state within gameplay, except for server logs and other dynamic data.</li>
</ol>

(1) requires us to obtain an appropriate set of hardware that will provide the appropriate service responsiveness to run the game server.  (2) requires us that the service will not go down when gameplay is in session; that is, the service must have a non-degraded state when in use.  Since the server will likely be used for at least 24 hours straight, we would want to make sure that the operating system, hardware, etc. can survive for at least that long without much downtime between each gaming session.  (3) requires us to use network monitoring tools.  (4) requires us to use both traditional ways of ensuring that file changes aren't done to critical files, as well as game server specific ways of ensuring that players won't be able to subvert the server through the game itself.

Since the game service itself is running in userspace on a single server, we can at least put forth our best effort in making everything else redundant.  Hard drives can be redundant, PSU's can be redundant, we can use two ethernet cards and pair them at the switch, etc.  But when we lead up to the game server, we run into problems.

A possible idea that could help mitigate these issues is to run a modified clustering kernel called <a href="http://www.kerrighed.org/">Kerrighed</a>; this, however, could lead to further problems: if say our software was multi-threaded, we can't necessarily predict which CPU (or in this case, which clustered computer) that the thread is on.  And so, if say one of the boxes goes down in the cluster, there's a chance that it will take down the thread with it as well.  If the software was single-threaded, then it will simply stay on whatever box it happens to land on, which isn't exactly making the service any more redundant.

Going back to the drawing board: ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the goals of systems administration is to keep systems and networks running properly.Â  One of the prerequisites to this goal is to preserve the state of the systems in our jurisdiction.Â  The reason why we are so concerned about state preservation is because it enables us to impose predictable "boundary conditions" on the system, and therefore, predict what may happen in the future.Â  State changes in a stable system are much easier: if we can predict what may happen in the future and we can ensure stability between the original state and the modified state, then we can execute the list of required actions between state A and state B, between state B and state C, etc. until we get to our desired state.</p>

<p>Thankfully, that is why we have frameworks like <a href="http://www.cfengine.org/">cfengine</a> and group policies (in Windows.)  I believe it's still an open research problem, but I don't know for sure.</p>

<p>However, there are actions and events that may introduce "entropy" into a system.  Behavior of autonomous agents could very well be deterministic, but still hard to predict; thus, we assume that actions from an autonomous agent on a system introduce entropy.  Any sort of influence that is introduced by phenomena that was not accounted for in setting up our system introduces entropy into the system.  In terms of computer systems and networks, users can accidentally download a worm and infect other machines with it, or they could fill up a server's hard drive, thus not allowing the server to write logs (or whatever else), they could hard lock a critical server on accident, etc.  Hardware can degrade and fail after running for several years, or computers can overheat and shutdown automatically.  Network crackers can actively scan for open ports and try to root a machine on the local network.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't think this is a sufficient argument against postmodernism (since, for one thing, postmodernism cannot seem to be defined by any of its proponents, nor does it take itself up as a definable philosophy), but I offer my arguments anyway, in hopes that it at least helps to show why the developments in "modern thought" are really not all that bad.

For one, much of postmodern thought seems to rest on rhetoric and linguistic flourishes which say almost nothing (or are self-contradictory) about whatever they are trying to express.  Perhaps it is because I am terrible at reading into metaphors or any other play on language, but I find that when I am reading, for instance, Descartes, or Kant, or some other philosopher before the 19th century, I learn much more about their position within, say, a page or two, than in postmodern works.  Also, it is considerably easier to find a counter-example or some sort of counter-argument against a modern philosophy than in a postmodern work, which says much more about the comprehensibility of the text than in the possible weakness of the position.  I fear that most people who read postmodern philosophical works simply accept the position because of the play on language and the multitude of interpretations we can derive from it, rather than on any rational grounds.  Maybe that is the point, but when we, for instance, grant acceptance of a position based on those grounds, then we elevate the position to a dogmatic status in the minds of the reader; I believe the point of the clarity of language in philosophical arguments is to make sure that there is no dogmatic acceptance of a position.

Second, postmodern thought seems to not require any training in a subject so analyzed by postmodernists in order to make a comment on it.  Textual analysis seems to fall into this objection as well, for most of the writings I've seen under the umbrella of postmodernism have tried to find hidden meanings behind the words written in a given piece of writing.  However, I find that when reading a given text, the principle of charity works well: is it not possible that the writer means only what he has written down?  And if there are interpretations of the text that we are not aware of, it seems that the set of interpretations for a given text is inherently limited in scope, not by the reader of the text (for the reader can list down a couple of interpretations depending on his own knowledge of the text and of the world), but rather by the writer of the text; that is, if say a writer has a sentence written down, like:
<blockquote>1.) The trees have fallen in the distance,</blockquote>
then it seems prudent that the sentence automatically dismisses any interpretations (depending on the sentence's surrounding context), like,
<blockquote>1.1.) The martians have abducted the cow,</blockquote>
insofar as the context does not have any martians, cows, or any metaphor referring to such objects or actions. Â So, to criticize a field for being sexist, racist, etc. by dismissing the content of its research through any outlying structure it might have (for instance, by reading a research paper by so-and-so scientist, we conclude that the theory is racist/sexist/etc., which is confirmed by the fact that there is a diminishing number of such-and-such minority) seems to be misguided at best.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I guess since I'm now reading about determinism and free will in my metaphysics class, I'll see whether determinism is really a plausible theory given chaotic systems and probabilistic models.

First, I'll use the definition for determinism given by van Inwagen (paraphrased):
<blockquote>Given the proposition P0 and time T0, we can take the conjunct of P0 and the set of laws of physics L and determine the proposition P at time T.</blockquote>
I take this to be equivalent to the following familiar definition when dealing with positions of objects at a certain point of time:
<blockquote>Given initial conditions P0 and T0 (position and time respectively), there is a function f such that for P and T, where T &gt; T0, f(P0, T0) = (P, T).</blockquote>
Alright, that's all well and good. Â Let's say that f(P0, T0) describes a non-linear dynamical system, like a Lorentz system.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, this doctrine is pretty much already known as a bankrupt philosophical position and is cast off very quickly in most philosophy classes, though it is seemingly widely adopted by many people and in many classes outside of philosophy. Â The most prevalent example is in the lower level English classes, where everyone expressing some sort of creative thesis about a book / movie / passage / whatever is somehow correct. Â The key phrase that is uttered is, "everyone has their own interpretation and all of them are correct."

Maybe I'm saddling the phrase with too harsh of an interpretation, but it's effects produce essays which go "deep" into the symbolism of whatever word / phrase / sentence and tend to get it <em>wrong</em>Â more than half the time. Â I'm not an English major, so that is also a place where people can criticize my position, but what I am worried mostly about is the fixation of a position expressed in a medium, and then claiming that it is true because the truth of any assertion is mostly individual, not public.

The core argument behind solipsism goes something like this:
<ol>
	<li>I am only certain of the content in my mind - my thoughts, my experiences, etc.;</li>
	<li>even if there are "minds" outside of mine, I cannot be sure of the content of other minds in the world;</li>
	<li>the experience of a given person is necessarily private.</li>
</ol>
The upshot of the solipsist position is that any sort of assertion made by any other person cannot be true nor false unless <em>I</em>Â have come up with a formulation of the assertion in my own mind, with the supporting arguments made for or against the assertion not necessarily having to mirror what the other person's supporting arguments are for the assertion. Â To put it another way, I can understand the assertion to mean something totally different than what another person has made it out to be, and whatever interpretation I grant the assertion, I can say it's true or false based on <em>my</em>Â reasons, which may or may not be sensical to the other person.

However, my refutation to this position is based mostly on language: language requires at least two participants, and once we attempt to communicate an idea, we have already granted that there is a mind outside of ours who will take in the idea and participate in the exchange. Â If we, say, communicate an idea and the other person just does not "get it," then we simply simplify or use a different metaphor to describe what we are trying to "get at." Â If someone rejects my idea because of <em>their</em>Â interpretation, then I would do the same thing: I would either whittle down my explanation so it's understandable, or use a different metaphor. Â To say in response to the person who doesn't get my idea that they just "don't get it" and cut the conversation off is to be intellectually dishonest.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(note: pragmatics is generally defined as the implicated use of language in an environment; compare this to semantics, which attempts to explain the meaning of a sentence by referring to the terms in the sentence.)

In the same way that a first order logic proposition is a scheme that must be further interpreted by a theory <em>T</em>, a sentence being uttered in a possible world <em>W</em>Â must be further interpreted within a set of propositions expressed in <em>W</em>Â (call these sets of propositions "the state of the world.") Â That is, when I say, "can you pass me the salt," there is already a well-defined semantic interpretation that is dependent only on the meanings of the terms within the sentence; when uttered in a possible world <em>W</em>, I interpret this sentence further depending on what is the case at that instant of time. Â In a restaurant, when <em>I</em>Â utter this sentence, <em>I</em>Â mean for the person in front of me to pick the salt up and give it to me. Â When the person in front of me hears this sentence, <em>he</em>Â understands me to mean that he should give me the salt. Â However, there is nothing in the semantics of the sentence that suggests this: when we analyze the sentence, we get an interpretation along the lines of, "in all possible worlds, it is possible for you to pass me the salt." Â Semantics of a sentence sets the field up for interpretation, and pragmatics ought to restrict the interpretation down to at least one interpretation.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a play that I'll have to help produce, act in, etc. for my third quarter Basic Tagalog class. Â The theme: Filipino-American Experience.

I've always felt a bit weird whenever people tried to generalize the overall Filipino-American experience. Â I had hinted inÂ <a href="http://blog.redbluemagenta.com/2008/02/24/film-notes-what-makes-a-film-filipino-american/">the past</a>Â that the entire struggle is one with identity and with the loss of culture. Â However, I don't think my experiences, as a Filipino-American, fit with the general conception of what it's like to be a Filipino-American. Â Most of my interactions with any sort of mainstay Filipino-American organization has always ended badly, because I wasn't Filipino enough, or because they wanted to really ride the ethnicity line all the way down, or whatever else.]]></content:encoded>

I've had only a handful of excellent teachers, and those were the ones who challenged the class as much as they can while making sure that the students understood the concepts that were flying by in lecture. Â English has been consistently good, I never was in honors until 11th grade, but there was a lot of good essay writing skills that I've learned that have helped me <em>a lot</em> in college. Â Math and science was a different matter; Mr. Brodsack and Mr. Nutting come into mind as two of the best math teachers I've had; however, the rest of them either played favoritism, wanted to be cool with the students (and therefore, killed the entire rigor of the subject matter), etc. Â History sucked. Â A lot.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've played the first two major iterations of the game a while ago, probably back in high school or during my first two years of college. Â For those of you guys who haven't heard of this game, it's a first person military game funded by the U.S. Government with the purpose of acquainting the public on how the U. S. Army combat doctrine generally operates, at least as far as how the U. S. Government wants us to view the Army doctrine. Â Me being a person who has never been in the Army, I have no clue whether the game's representation of military doctrine generally mirrors actual military doctrine, but I think I'm safe in saying that it doesn't give us a glimpse whatsoever in any sort of sentiments that may or may not be felt by any individual soldier.

In any case,]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Breakout from scratch, Part II: A rough sketch of the game mechanics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The rules of the game of Breakout are pretty simple: destroy all of the bricks with a ball and paddle without losing all of your lives. Â However, we also constrain ourselves (or rather, the game forces us) to follow a few other implicit rules as well:
<ol>
	<li>There exists a well-defined rectangular game board.</li>
	<li>The paddle only moves left and right, and we are not allowed to move the paddle beyond the game screen.</li>
	<li>The ball never goes beyond the game screen.</li>
	<li>The ball always moves in straight lines.</li>
	<li>The bricks are as solid as the borders of the game screen, except they disappear after you hit them.</li>
	<li>The only time the ball disappears is when it hits the bottom part of the screen.</li>
	<li>The bricks never move.</li>
	<li>The above rules are the only rules that any game object obeys.</li>
</ol>
Some of these sound extremely silly, but they <em>must</em> be made explicit, so that we know <em>exactly</em> what sort of things we need to program. Â The computer is a dumb, but fast brute.

Anyway, let's get right to the punch. Â We will expand upon each rule and how we can generally implement it in the game.
<ul>
	<li>Rule (1): we will have to explicitly program the dimensions of the game board which we will consistently refer to when checking for game object collisions. Â This is easy enough in C++, we would create a global constant object / struct which would represent the game board.</li>
	<li>Rule (2): We will have to think about this a bit carefully. Â We would first have to define exactly how the paddle is constructed: we could just define the paddle by explicitly constructing all of the sides of the paddle, or we can just define the left and top sides of the paddle and draw the other two sides from those two pieces of information. Â Why does this matter? Â Because we will either be updating the position of two sides or four sides of the paddle every time it's moved! Â But for now, this won't matter, if we're only concerned with the constraints we put on the object as a whole; we can simply deal with it later when we're implementing the paddle object itself. Â In any case, when we press the left arrow button, we translate the paddle to the left, and when we press the right arrow button, we translate the paddle to the right. Â If the left border of the paddle is on top of the left border of the game screen, we don't update the paddle position. Â Same thing when we're going to the right and we come upon the right border of the screen.</li>
	<li>Rule (3): This basically means that we have to check for collisions at every moment that the game is running to make sure that the ball never is allowed beyond the game screen. Â If it hits the left, top, or right borders, we use our collision algorithm to calculate what the new trajectory will be.</li>
	<li>Rule (4): This means that the ball has zero acceleration magnitude along any of the normal vectors to where it's traveling (basically, this ensures it has a straight line path.)</li>
	<li>Rule (5): We would have to program explicitly in our collision detection algorithm that we have to look out for bricks, too.</li>
	<li>Rule (6):</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>(Inspired from a post by Matt Simmons on <a href="http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/2010/08/xenophobia-and-elitism-in-the-community/">Xenophobia in the system administration community</a>.)</em>

More often than not, we're predisposed to accepting positions based on how it resonates with our own assumptions; if say we're a Democrat and we stumble upon an argument that Democrats generally accept, then it tends to be the case that you will accept the argument, too.  This is the sort of thing that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon">Francis Bacon</a> warned us about several hundred years ago, and it's the sort of thing that denies valid arguments and ideas from receiving the notice that they deserve.

I've witnessed this myself, not only in my own profession, but also in many other groups as well.  The only way to stay our opinions is to often question our beliefs, and come to the conclusion that <em>we could be completely wrong</em>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My lineage comes from the Philippines; I'm the first person in my family who was actually born in the United States.

I've been stripping away nearly everything that's associated with me being a Filipino.  Part of the reason why was because I have had more than a few times where contact with Filipinos outside of my family has ended up pretty badly (read: the only thing they would tell me was how I was NOT a Filipino.)  That, and other people outside of my ethnicity have treated me much better and I grew up in Ballard, to which I knew only one or two other Filipino families living there.  Another reason is because I've renounced key things that predicates Filipino-ness: I'm vegetarian and I'm definitely not religious.  I don't speak Tagalog, mostly out of my own ignorance.  I did take a year long sequence of Tagalog classes at the UW, but I forgot everything that I learned in that class; after all, I don't hang out much with Tagalog speaking Filipinos anymore.

I want nothing to do with Filipinos my age who are "old school."]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The value of open standards and open protocols</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>(Note: this is an apology arguing for the value of open standards and protocols.  I am not writing in defense of open source/free software in general: that is for another discussion.)</em>

I am writing this as an appeal to those who would otherwise think that <em>de facto standards</em> are just as good as open standards.  We've been using formats such as .doc and .jpeg for quite a while, and sure enough, they are ubiquitous enough for everyone to adopt them as shared medium of expressing thought on the internet.  However, I will argue for the following points as to why one should instead adopt <em>de jure standards</em>, or what I would otherwise call <em>open standards</em>:

<ol>
<li>in order to truly communicate in the same space, we need properly documented and accepted standards and protocols in order to facilitate communication,</li>
<li>in the interest of preserving communications as a part of documenting our history, we need to communicate with said standards and protocols,</li>
<li>finally, using open standards and protocols (as both users and implementers) allows one to freely choose a piece of software based on their merits in the same competitive space, and not in a secluded area where the software vendors are the only arbiters of communication.</li>
</ol>

I will continue to use the terms <em>de facto standards/protocols</em> and <em>de jure standards/protocols</em>, as I think these phrases better expose the issue at hand.

<h3>(1): in order to truly communicate in the same space, we need properly documented and accepted standards and protocols in order to facilitate communication.</h3>

Let's assume that this is not the case, that everyone can communicate with anyone else (on a computer) without necessarily using properly documented and accepted standards and protocols.  The original assertion may sound crazy, considering that human languages evolve without anyone having to lay down rules at every step of the way (a grammarian would think otherwise, but I think languages evolve too quickly for a grammarian to keep pace.)  However, ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Usually there's a period of time when you first start the job where you have to orient yourself with the site (a few more experienced sysadmins have hinted to me that this period doesn't really end until roughly two or three months into the job), and more often than not, there's an orientation given by the other sysadmins in the team (or maybe by another member of the technical staff.)

However, there's probably a number of things that will inevitably be missed during the orientation period (or depending on how you view it, you will want to speed up the process so you can get work done in a shorter period of time.)

Here's a list of things I've cooked up that ought to be asked, either to the sysadmins or of yourself when you're investigating a particular site (I've broken them down into several groups for easy viewing):

		<title>Take on complexity so that the customers don&#039;t have to</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is somewhat of an extension to <a href="http://www.redbluemagenta.com/2010/07/09/the-focus-of-it-to-let-other-people-get-stuff-done/">a previous blog post</a> of mine about the focus of IT.  I now want to make my point a lot more explicit: customers do not want any unneeded complexity while working on a particular network or product, and so what we really should be doing, as systems administrators, is take on a lot more of the complexity and make it as easy as possible for the customer.

A lot of admins out there will likely not agree with me, but I believe the disagreement would root mostly on how we view the customer.  Sysadmins in general wish to have their systems be in top shape for as long as possible, but some may want this to be the case, despite the customers' presence.  But I think the scenario is quite different: we keep the system up <em>because</em> of the customers' presence and need of the service.

For instance, when we deploy services, we need to make sure, if it's customer facing, that we involve the customer as much as possible into the process.  The reason why <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/669-why-enterprise-software-sucks">enterprise software sucks</a> is because the vendors do not involve the customer (or in this case, vendors negotiate with someone who is not the principal user of the software); same goes with any network/system service that anyone needs to utilize, we involve the customer during planning to make sure that our service is actually simple and easy for them to use, and not a huge behemoth with several walls we have to break through just to use a service.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Take any 2 digit (or higher) number and reverse the ordering of its digits.

[ example: Let the number be 110.  The reverse ordering will be 011. ]

Now add the two numbers together.

[ example: 110 + 011 = 121. ]

Keep doing this until you get a palindrome.  110, in this case, is a palindrome after one iteration of this algorithm.

The main crux of this algorithm is that the number 196 along with a specific sequence of numbers (Lychrel Numbers) does NOT net a palindrome with this algorithm.  It is, however, just a hypothesis and remains unproved so far if it does indeed have no palindrome associated with it.  So far, there's been records of people going through at least ten million iterations of the algorithm with no success so far in finding a palindrome associated with the number 196.

It seems like an interesting problem to check out...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I finally finished that fucking essay that I had to write for my comp. lit. class.  I'm a bit proud of it actually; it's three quarters sincere and one quarters bullshit, though it's hastily put together and isn't the greatest of prose.  It does, however, seem to cover at least some of my thoughts on human interaction in general.  Here it is, don't worry if it makes no sense, there's a lot of assumptions I've made about the reader's knowledge on what went on in the lectures.

<h3>THE ESSAY</h3>

The kernel of human love is relatively unchanged through the history of man.  There are of course ever increasing complexities and ever changing societal norms that dictate what is conventional and what is expected in an interaction, but the very core of love, the type of love that is unshakable and is anything but conventional, is something that remains unchanged between generations.  It is the intense passion that one feels toward another person, free from any sort of constraints.  However, this often runs contrary to what they believe to be true, and the enormity of accepting a contrary but inevitably true position perpetuates the personâs fear of accepting it completely.  When we come across different events, we do the deed that brings the event to a conclusion, and depending on how critical it is of our own humanity, it transforms us to a degree.  However, when we come to the greatest of termini, the one that not only brings an event to a conclusion but also scrapes closely with our own humanity, it has a great propensity to transform who we are as a human, for in terminus lies transformation.  The lens that we will use to analyze this phenomenon will be through Charlesâ predicament at the end of Four Weddings and a Funeral and through the eventual death of Andrei.

Throughout Four Weddings and a Funeral, Charles and a group of his friends attend different weddings with the hopes of finding a wife, which is the only revealed way to âtrue love.â  It is by its very nature conventional; in order to be a part of society and to maneuver through it successfully, one of the things one must do is to marry another person.  Because it is conventional, there is a hint of human insincerity associated with it, since it is a social construct that one must forcefully put themselves through in order to be associated with said society.  The same can be said with Andreiâs quest to become a glorious hero through a glorious death; it is the greatest thing that one could achieve yet it is conventional - it is something that everyone expects of a soldier when he goes to war.

Instead, what happens is that Charles finds emptiness in such an enterprise, as much as Andrei finds nothing in a glorious death.  However, it isnât until they clash with the onset of a terminus that they find the emptiness in such conventions.  In Charlesâ case, he starts to see how empty the marriage proceedings are when Carrie reveals that she is separated; true love is rediscovered, he breaks the wedding plans and he commits non-marriage to Carrie.  For Andrei, as he struggles with retaining himself in the material world and fearing the usurpation of his life, he finally discovers that there is a sort of emptiness in holding so closely with his ego and with his body; he finds true love with Natasha, he finally greets death with open arms, and finally finds simplicity in life.

It is this sort of simplicity that motivates termini.  When we drift far away from the simplicity of human interaction and delve into the complexities of man made constructs, we become complacent and disconnected.  And then, suddenly, there is something that connects us back to the baser ideas of humanity, something that shows us that there is something simpler than the juggling acts of high society, yet it is something that we normally avoided out of fear and contempt.  It is related to the issue of the destruction of the wish with a simple deed; the deed is closer to the base ideas of âhuman,â whereas the wish is a man-made construct that seeks to further disconnect man from his humanity.  The deed, in this case, is the act that brings one to terminus, and therefore, a transformation.  It destroys his wish to be a grander human than himself as well as destroy, implicitly, the wish of others for the man in question to become a man of society rather than a man of humanity.

Marriage, by its nature, is complex, since it is a construct made by man.  Since it is not simple, it cannot possibly be close to what true love is.  True love can sprout from marriage, but it would be completely peripheral to the act of marrying someone; that is, marriage does not, by itself, motivate the idea of true love.  In Four Weddings and a Funeral, Charles, ignorant near the beginning of the movie, rejects marriage with Carrie after sleeping with her, because in his mind, marriage is tied completely to true love, and since he does not truly love her, he does not marry her.  She is equally as ignorant to the separation and takes it as a sign of non-interest.  However, at the end of the movie, Carrieâs separation from Hamish and Charlesâ realization that he does not truly love Henrietta destroys the societal notion of marriage equaling true love.  This destruction of complexity is done only through terminus, and through that destruction is there a transformation.

The fear of the unknown is something that we cannot ever dispel, since if we could dispel it, then we would have transcended time, which cannot be done.  The frantic rationalization of this unknown â in this case, the rationalization of death â is complex.  We postulate that there is a way to greet death or that there is a way to avoid it, or to even live life in order to have as good of a death as possible.  This is, however, a complex layering of rationalizations that simply abstracts away the notion of simplicity in the act.  Humans die, and that is it; there is no other way to go around it, it simply happens and it is thus a natural terminus.  The fear of death before we die is there due to societal constraints, since we wish to accomplish more before we die.  The acceptance of death as a terminus by the dying releases their bond to what is complex and accepts death for what it is: a natural terminus, something that is inevitable, something that they cannot stop and must accept as true.

So is the terminus inevitable?  Is it in its nature such that there is no leeway in action when we approach a terminus; that is, do we lose our free will in the face of circumstance?  It is inevitable, but we do have the free will to delay it.  But once it arrives, it is not avoidable, we cannot delay it any further, the only way it will be resolved is if it happens right then and there.  In the case of death, we can leap away and dance around the subject as well as not accept the fact that we are going to die when we are on our death bed, but it will happen no matter what.  For Charles, the terminus can be delayed if he chose to marry Henrietta, but he chose to simply accept the terminus as it is and transform himself in the process.  In fact, if he married Henrietta, since he does not love her and has his own heart in Carrie, he would have had to face the terminus anyway no matter what.  When we do face the terminus however, we only have two choices, which are to face it right then and there or to delay it, which simply leads to another two choice branch later in time.  If we have more than two choices, then we have not reached a terminus, but rather an insignificant event that simply compounds on the personâs beliefs rather than transform him in a significant way that a terminus would.

In conclusion, Andrei and Charles both find simplicity in human interaction, but cannot possibly have come to that conclusion without a terminus that cuts their ties to the complexities of societal constructs.  It is through this terminus that they find transformation; in Andreiâs case, it is the approaching terminus of incipient death that leads him to find true love in Natasha and love for life in itself rather than the egotistical accomplishments that are accomplished in said life.  For Charles, the terminus of marriage causes him to find true love in Carrie, and to strip away the complexities of marriage and to find the core of human essence in his love for Carrie.  These transformations were inevitable as they tumbled around in the world trying to find such things within the boundaries of society, until the inevitable terminus hits them in the head and brings them back down to reality.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're into installing stuff into your computer and if you're into music, then get this sound card ASAPASPAPAPSAP

It's fucking great.  I replaced the easily replaceable OPAMPs on the card with LM4562's from National Semiconductor and threw the card into my computer.  I use a set of Klipsch Promedia Ultra 5.1 speakers as well as a pair of Sennheiser eH350's.

As a quick overview of the features, you can use Dolby Headphone, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, DTS Neo:PC, Dolby Digital Live, DTS-Connect, and various other stuff.  There's a way better rundown of the features on the <a href="http://www.auzentech.com/site/products/x-meridian.php">Auzentech website</a>.

The sound quality on my speakers went up a bit, though I don't think I have a good enough ear for these sort of things.  For some reason, I think I'm limited by the speakers themselves; a lot of other people with very high end equipment on avsforum.com and various other forums said that they heard a HUGE jump in quality.

However, it's A LOT better on my headphones.  It sounds great without any sort of the Dolby Headphone stuff; the vocals are more airy and lifelike compared to my Audigy 2.  With Dolby Headphone on, it's almost scary how lifelike it sounds; Dolby Headphone basically emulates a surround sound system in a larger room.  This, in combination with the already airy and "out of head" sound of the vocals and the more detailed instrumentation, makes it sound like the artists are actually in front of me.

The only real problem is the price: ~$170-$190 at Newegg.com.

But yeah, buy the sound card if you're really into listening to music with good quality equipment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've a bunch of computer parts coming in the mail later this week... I'm excited as shit, I haven't had a full overhaul in quite a long time.  Instead of the water cooling setup that I have setup for my desktop computer right now, I'm going to go all air and hope that it cools my computer down adequately.  In any case, here's what I'm getting:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811163075">Silverstone TJ09-B Black Aluminum ATX Case</a></li>

Well, almost everything.  The stuff in the bubble wrap in the lower right corner is the hard drive as well as a floppy drive.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(WORD OF WARNING: Like a lot of my rants, this particular piece doesn't have any citation to any sources at all, mostly because I'm too lazy to look up the stuff that I've already read.  If you want to confirm/disprove any of the facts, go right ahead, I won't stop you. :))

I caught myself wandering around the UW campus again for an hour or two.

I was thinking of a lot of things, mostly reflecting inward and shuffling through a few loose ends.  However, after I started heading back to my house, something clicked in my head, something that I was ruminating about for a couple of months but was confirmed once I started walking back to my house: humans NEED companionship.

Of course it's true, this sort of necessity of companionship is seen in almost all social animals, but for humans, there are usually other distractions that pull individuals toward relative isolation, especially in modern, urban society.  The effects of this sort of isolation, while kept at bay with NEW STUFF, can be quite damaging; this isn't restricted to humans (except for the "new stuff" part, I don't think animals care about "new stuff"), I believe there was a bit of research done with various animals which proved that isolation leads to the inability to communicate and relate to others, which translates almost perfectly to human behavior.

In any case... well, I suppose the main thing that I'm trying to get at is that there's a lot of disconnection between individuals; it doesn't help that our generation (that is, the current 16-24 year olds) are proven to be the most narcissistic generation ever, but indeed the narcissism and disconnection seems to be markedly connected with the trends of American culture and the marginalization of the individual in commercialism and whatnot.

I doubt there's a solution to this problem, at least not a solution that we could actively contribute to.  It DOES help if we take the conscious effort to at least be a bit more open, but that alone does not change societal and cultural trends...

(PS: This is probably a very ignorant post; maybe within a few days/weeks/years my stance and knowledge on this issue will change.  We'll see.)]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There's no doubt we are pack, and thus, social animals.  I would dispute your assertion that your generation is the more narcissistic.  Every generation that comes along will claim that title.  I don't think it matters.

Now that you have this insight, what do you plan on doing about it?  Rather than focusing on being social to be happy, do what makes you happy, then you will naturally be social.  I find people who are not social tend to be unhappy, the solution is to find happiness within oneself, then people will naturally gravitate to those who are having fun.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I saw him earlier this evening over at Jazz Alley here in Seattle.  He's doing stuff until Sunday, so if you guys just missed tonight's show, you guys definitely have more chances to check him out.

God damn, this was a great introduction to world class jazz performances; I've seen other jazz performances over at my university, but nothing like this.  His quartet was simply amazing and full of energy.

I'm thinking about convincing my dad and brother to take my mom over to Jazz Alley this Sunday for mother's day.

Anyway, yeah, I'm still fucking happy that I was able to finally see this dude in action!  A picture might be going up sometime in the near future of... Branford's signature ;p]]></content:encoded>

It could have to do with the fact that I find inspiration to write something at around 3:00 AM every night, though the fact that me wanting to sleep at 3:00 AM doesn't help things at all.  In any case, you might see a bunch of posts sometime in the near future.  Hopefully.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was thinking a lot about Tom's comment on <a href="http://blog.redbluemagenta.com/2007/05/02/a-confirmation-of-my-thoughts-on-human-needs-as-it-relates-to-modern-society/#comments">a previous blog post of mine</a>; I completely do agree with it, and I feel that that is indeed the solution to this dilemma of mine, but here are the issues that I'm having trouble resolving:

How can I, for instance, enjoy the things that I truly want to enjoy if I am not happy?  For example, I do enjoy studying math, but I simply cannot concentrate on it when I find myself always perpetually thinking about negative crap that happened in the past (usually in social situations.)  Often, I also find myself hopping on the computer in order to get my mind off such things, but I know that I am not happy when I do this, but simply neutral and apathetic.

And also, if I cannot enjoy the things that would make me happy without relying on anyone else's company, then how then do I become independent from other's opinions?

Perhaps these questions simply lead to a single answer: "you're just copping out, try harder."  And yes, I would agree with that answer as well, but I feel that I just don't have the motivation anymore to deal with this sort of crap.

I did have a date with someone not too long ago, but I feel that because of this sort of insecurity that I have, I ended up not presenting myself in the best light possible.  It's been killing me (even if it shouldn't; after all, there's a lot of women out there) mostly because I feel that if I was indeed happy with myself, things would've went along a lot smoother.

Man, I don't know.  This sucks.  I don't know if I articulated myself well enough, but yeah...

EDIT: I honestly think that I am depressed.  I've gone through several counselors/therapists, usually through the school, and haven't had much success yet.  I'm going to try again and see if I can also get some sort of anti-depressant medication going as well.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ian, the first thing to investigate is to figure out if there is an organic/biological etiology to your feeling of being unhappy.  Next is to determine if it is psychiatric, such as a personality trait, which would require therapy and more hardwork on your part.

There are many stressors in modern life that we, as human beings, have not yet adapted to and we all struggle (in our own ways).

After you have ruled those out or resolved them, then work on doing things you like and trying other/new activities.  My cliche is "Happiness comes from within, not from without."  Unless you are an extravert, no amount of external validation will make you happy.  Accept yourself, being at peace with yourself, rather than constantly seeking external stimuli for happiness.  Ultimately, you have live with and live for yourself.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 .... = 1/2

Weird shit.  Look at the following:

(1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + ... = 0

but

1 + (-1 + 1) + (-1 + 1) ... = 1

Furthermore, let's treat it as a regular infinite series with partial sums:

S = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 ...
1 - S = 1 - (1 - 1 + 1 - 1 .... ) = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 ... = S

1 - S + S = 1 = 2S (since 1 - S = S)
thus, S = 1/2

This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandi%27s_series">Grandi's Series</a>.  It's practically equivalent to the geometric series with r = -1.  Weird shit, eh?

You can also solve the problem with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ces%C3%A0ro_summation">CesÃ ro summation</a>.

But yeah, just show people the equation and watch as they try to solve the problem]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm going to start a series of posts that will offer a bit of my thoughts on a book I'm going to trudge through for the next two months.  The book is called <u>The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations</u> by Christopher Lasch.  I've read through the preface and started the first chapter, and already I'm finding myself agreeing with many of the propositions that the author brings forth in his introduction of the book.

In any case, I'm simply going to list down a bunch of various fragmented thoughts on what's in the book, which will probably be the format that will follow in the next few posts.

Society has turned from a culture that values historicity to one that values the present over everything else; that is, we start to look at history as nostalgia rather than as a continuum leading up to the present day, which has the consequence of also eliminating looking toward the future, since we do not think that the future will consider the present as relevant (in other words, there is no historical context.)

We have turned toward the self as a bit of an extreme interpretation of the basis of American society - the pursuit of happiness - and as a result, bankrupted the value of interactions with those around us.

Great quote at the beginning of the first section:

<blockquote>The Marivaudian being is, according to Poulet, a pastless futureless man, born anew at every instant.  The instants are points which organize themselves into a line, but what is important is the instant, not the line.  The Marivaudian being has in a sense no history.  Nothing follows from what has gone before.  He is constantly surprised.  He cannot predict his own reaction to events.  He is constantly being <i>overtaken</i> by events.  A condition of breathlessness and dazzlement surrounds him.
- Donald Barthelme</blockquote>

It seems to sum up the overall message that I've seen so far in the first section: the modern, narcissistic man has no historicity and thus has no guidance through his journey.

The main motivators for narcissism after the 60's seem to be fueled mostly by survivalist ideals; living in the now and relishing in the moment versus living as a continuation of your ancestors and living as a seed for future generations.

That's it for now, more notes later!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just wanted to quote a passage from the book that seems to resonate quite strongly with me:

<blockquote>Schur himself notes that "what seems ultimately to emerge out of this very mixed message is an ethic of self-preservation."  But his condemnation of the survival ethic as a "retreat into privatism" misses the point.  When personal relations are conducted with no other object than psychic survival, "privatism" no longer provides a haven from a heartless world.  On the contrary, private life takes on the very qualities of the anarchic social order from which it is supposed to provide a refuge.  It is the devastation of personal life, not the retreat into privatism, that needs to be criticized and condemned.  The trouble with the consciousness movement is not that it addresses trivial or unreal issues but that it provides self-defeating solutions.  Arising out of a pervasive dissatisfaction with the quality of personal relations, it advises people not to make too large an investment in love and friendship, to avoid excessive dependence on others, and to live for the moment - the very conditions that created the crisis of personal relations in the first place.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey, what's up.  I'm trying to figure out a couple of things: what sector of society this culture of narcissism is resonating with, and its origins.  Without understanding those, the "consciousness movement" (is that the same?) seems too nebulous.

I mean, there were cultural changes brought about by liberal radicals in the 60s, but the "narcissism" isn't only confined to them.  Many of todays cultural conservatives are just as narcissistic in many, albeit different ways.

I guess I'm just wondering if we need to be more clear about where this culture comes from.  There could be so many variables - the economy, religion, academics, changing world landscape.

Like Herman said at 365 (kind of), how does globalization &amp; technology play into all this.  Our fast paced, jam packed lives is very disruptive to community relations.  Yet at the same time it allows for  a much more expansive sense of "global identity" - which is kind of at odds with narcissism.

I'm thinking of the Singer idea, where people are willing to make sacrifices relative to how "connected" the feel to the receiver - family - friend - ethnic/cultural group - nationality - geography.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That's a major downfall of the book, IMO: it seems way too general and doesn't really put a clamp on exactly where this thing comes from.  If I interpreted it correctly, he assumes that it's a singular cultural movement that swept over every aspect of Western culture, which he himself is struggling to find out exactly where it came from (he jumps between 20th century and 19th century views quite a bit.)

As for the culture that it seemingly resonates with... well, it SEEMS that it permeates mostly in urban areas.  And, well, dare I say it, Seattle seems to be the best example of "new narcissism" (look up "Seattle Freeze" on Google)

Interesting question you bring up about globalization/technology by the way, I'll have to look more into that... but wouldn't a "global identity" sort of lend itself to narcissism (if I'm getting you correctly)?  I mean, if you are talking about, for instance, the increasing usage of blogs, Youtube, etc. in order to establish some sort of globalized identity, then wouldn't that be narcissistic by its very nature?

I'm not too familiar with the "Singer" thing btw, can you elaborate a bit further on that?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems that the word "narcissism" is, nowadays, often attributed to every sort of selfish act, which eliminates the historic specificity that is needed to analyze the trend of human interaction.

"New Narcissism" is characterized by the following behavioral symptoms: fear of dependence, sense of inner emptiness, boundless repressed rage, and unsatisfied oral cravings.

There are also secondary traits: pseudo self-insight, calculating seductiveness, nervous, self-deprecatory humor.

Since the critics of narcissism fail to investigate the psychological aspect of narcissism in fear of obfuscating the social impact of the phenomenon, they, ironically, do indeed obfuscate the social impact and fail to reveal the characteristics of contemporary culture, such as the fear of old age and death, altered sense of time, fascination with celebrity, fear of competition, decline of the play spirit, and deteriorating relations between men and women.

(lists above are quoted directly from the book)

There's a ton of Freudian psychology floating around in the second chapter, with Lasch often using psychoanalysis as a means to explain overall social problems.  It proves as a way to investigate the individual as a product of the society that his personality is rooted in; neuroses and psychoses is, thus, a sort of expression of a given culture.

Clinical writing has seemingly recognized narcissism as an important element in the "character disorders" that are now observed by psychiatrists rather than hysteria and obsessive neuroses that were investigated before.

Secondary narcissism (as opposed to primary narcissism, which is observed in infants when they perceive their mothers as having a combined existence with themselves) is rooted in the attempts to annul the pain of disappointed object love.  Separation and frustration from such object love leads the person in question to create fantasies of an omnipotent mother or father; they wish to recreate a wished for love relationship and to annul anxiety and guilt aroused by aggressive drives directed against the frustrating and disappointing object. (paraphrased)

Experiences of rage and envy are compensated by fantasies of wealth, beauty, and omnipotence, along with images of the good parents he has conjured in his mind.  These lend to a core of the "grandiose conception of the self."

Constant projection of "bad" self and object images perpetuate an image of a dangerous world with threatening objects, where "good" self images are used defensively, and ideal self images are built up.

This seems to be in line with the rise of self-help psychology, where we try to conceive of an ideal image in order to obtain an ideal result from a world that is perceived as dangerous.

Intense feelings of emptiness and inauthenticity in a modern world seem to be motivated by the thinly populated intrapsychic world of the patient, where the population only consists of the "grandiose self."  Thus, anything lesser than the "grandiose self," namely the "true self" and other people, are devalued.

The narcissist attaches himself to constant approval and admiration from other people, living in an almost parasitic existence with others.  However, the narcissist also fears emotional dependence and uses a manipulative approach to personal relations, making said parasitic relations bland, superficial, and highly unsatisfying.  He is chronically bored and in search of instantaneous intimacy, thus usually making the narcissist promiscuous and pansexual.

The narcissist is always looking for therapeutic solutions to his sense of emptiness, often looking toward religion or a way of life, as a way to find external support for his fantasies of omnipotence and eternal youth.

To enjoy life with a growing identification with other people's successes and happiness seems to be largely impossible and beyond the capacity of those with narcissistic personalities.

Shift of personalities: the capable "organization man" to the bureaucratic "gamesman," where the efficient workings of the work place in dealing with materials turns toward dealing with people in the office.  Accumulation of wealth and building an empire is thrown in the back while the exhilaration of gaining victories and running a team come to the forefront.  That is, it seems that self-esteem is also now a central portion of running a company, where winning is the deepest joy and losing is deeply feared.  Getting ahead of others is the goal, not getting ahead.  The gamesman seems to be devoid of convictions and morals, where he will deal with any organization, no matter how unscrupulous it may be, just to get ahead of others around him.  The modern executive relies on the admiration or fear he inspires in others so he can solidify his credentials as a "winner."  However, when the adolescent thrills of winning are lost, the gamesman starts to become depressed and goalless, with no sense of purpose in his life.  He realizes he is alone in a sort of "midlife crisis."

Quick aside: this relates a lot to chapter 4, where Lasch deals with the issue of politics in America with narcissism at the forefront.  The government, more infatuated with its image rather than with the truth and caution, will rely more on the charisma and "truthiness" of an event or a set of data in order to convince the public of their ability to solve problems.  This, along with contemporary media, gives a more unrealistic view of the world seemingly disconnected from historical context, which relies more on imagery rather than what is actually happening.

Bureaucracy and mechanical reproduction of culture are two of several social influences of bringing a narcissistic personality out to the forefront.  Photographs, television, etc. lends itself to showing the viewer that, yes, he himself might be judged as if he will be put on photograph himself.  We then know now that we need not be reminded to smile, because we already have a smile graven on our faces, and of course it is the perfect smile that we know looks best in several angles.

This sort of proliferation of recorded images in modern culture undermines our sense of reality.  Photographic images are a sort of proof of our own existence.  Compared to the 18th and 19th century portraits - which were painted in order to express a bourgeois family's status - today's imagery is simply a validation of our own existence.

Modern medicine seems to have also created insecurities in potential patients; any blemishes, signs of aging, etc. are easily fixable by modern medicine, but are thus constantly sought out by potential patients in order to ensure that they are without disease and blemishes.

Great quote at the end of a particular section:

<blockquote>Nothing succeeds like the appearance of success.</blockquote>

Celebrity/envy is seen as more important in contemporary culture than respect/privacy.

In fact, private life is now pervaded by public life, taking on characteristics of the antagonisms presented in public life and becoming more and more warlike.  Self-help books now emphasize the cocktail party as a battleground of social manipulation and wit, with the goal of being the center of attention no matter the cost.

Americans have become more adept at exploiting interpersonal relations for their own benefit.  Most activities now have the goal of simply doing others in.

Marquis de Sade imagined a sexual utopia where everyone is absolutely anonymous and interchangeable, thus reducing the human to a market value.  Sade was the first to realize that in organized anarchy, pleasure becomes life's only business, with no distinction between sex, rape, murder, and unbridled aggression.  Immediate gratification of every desire, no matter how criminal, insane, or immoral it may be, is a consequence of reducing reason to mere calculation.

Another quote from the end of chapter 3:

<blockquote>The bourgeois defense of privacy culminates - not just in Sade's thought but in the history to come, so accurately foreshadowed in the very excess, madness, infantilism of his ideas - in the most thoroughgoing attack on privacy; the glorification of the individual, in his annihilation.</blockquote>

Advertising changed from informing the viewer of the truths of the product in the 19th century (and possibly early 20th century) to inciting a feeling of restlessness, unsatisfaction, anxiety, and boredom in the consumer in contemporary culture.  Advertising now promotes consumption as a way of life rather than simply informing the viewer of the product.  Objects take on the aura of romance with allusions to exotic places and vivid experiences, and, as Lasch points out quite nicely, "with images of female breasts from which all blessings flow."

Alienation itself turns into a commodity; desolation of modern life is shown to be cured by consumption, which in turn creates or exacerbates new forms of unhappiness, such as personal insecurity, status anxiety, etc.

Advertising also latches onto the "sexual revolution," where women are "liberated" from male oppression and the young from authority of their elders.  Freedom to consume is disguised as genuine autonomy.

ALRIGHT, finally, I'm done writing for now.  This was a long fucking post.  Hopefully you guys reached the end of this thing unscathed.]]></content:encoded>

However, I decided to go for summer quarter in order to actually do something productive during the summer.

The UW, however, decided that instead of offering more money to pay for tuition for summer through spring, they spread the whole thing out so that I have a $700 deficit that I have to pay out of pocket each quarter.

GAYED.

I will have to figure it out somehow.  Either that or become super smart so I get super smart scholarships to cover tuition.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hahah, I was reading through the introduction of "The Art of Programming" by Donald Knuth, and he had an example set of problems that demonstrated his problem difficulty rating system.

Here was the third question:

[M50]: Prove that when n is an integer, n > 2, the equation x^n + y^n = z^n has no solution in positive integers x, y, z.

(M50 is M = math oriented question, 50 = research [extremely tough] problem)

For those who don't know what the question is or why I put it up there, it is Fermat's Last Theorem, which at the time of writing was unsolved (the book was first published in the 60's, and Fermat's Last Theorem was proved correct in the 90's.)  Fermat's Last Theorem was actually one of the longest unresolved math problems in math history...

I've gotta say, Knuth has a great sense of humor and wit.]]></content:encoded>

It sucked.  No proofs, it's all simple calculations.  And Koblitz was easily the worst professor I've had for the thirty minutes I managed to stay in the class.

Needless to say, I dropped the class right after I left.

I'll probably just take the Number Theory topics class when it comes up in Spring Quarter.

In other news, the huge black box with the camera that I picked up from classroom support services today weighs more than my head.  More on this later.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["God grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to change the things we can, and wisdom to know the difference."

I'm not very religious at all, but I find a lot of wisdom in the above quote; there's simply too many things that happen beyond our control, and most of what can be changed is simply within ourselves, or rather, within our interpretations of what's happening in front of us.

If we change our interpretations of the circumstances, we can change how we deal with them.  However, we are usually too locked in our thoughts and believe them to be completely true, whereas the opposite or any gradient between the two thoughts can be equally as true, given ample time to dissect the thought and reinterpret what's happening in front of us.

I actually just bought a book called "Loving What Is" by Byron Katie, and it talks a lot about how to simply accept the circumstances as they are rather than sticking with an INTERPRETATION of the circumstance.  Okay, so it's a self-help book, and this post sounds like a shameless advertisement, but the questions presented in the book that challenge our thoughts seem to be universal in terms of unraveling our sufferings with ourselves.  It's helping me quite a bit with what I've been thinking about lately.  I'll post the questions that it poses a little later, probably within a day or two.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was talking to a physics professor in Cafe Allegro that I've heard about and seen a couple of times at Seattle University.  We were talking a lot about various subjects in mathematics as well as his research in physics.  While we were talking, he mentioned a few books that I'm thinking about checking out at the library that sound extremely interesting, and in one case, extremely important.

Here's a brief list of those books along with links to the corresponding Amazon page:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Two-Cultures-Canto-C-Snow/dp/0521457300/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-2734143-8902449?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186609971&sr=8-1">The Two Cultures by C. P. Snow</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prime-Obsession-Bernhard-Greatest-Mathematics/dp/0452285259/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-2734143-8902449?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186609983&sr=8-1">Prime Obsession by Bernhard Derbyshire</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Riemanns-Zeta-Function-Harold-Edwards/dp/0486417409/ref=sr_1_1/002-2734143-8902449?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186610001&sr=8-1">Riemann's Zeta Function by Harold Edwards</a>

The first book, <u>The Two Cultures</u>, is the important book that I mentioned earlier; it describes the disparate cultures between the two classes of intelligentsia, which are the literary intellectuals and the scientists.  It basically talks about how the literary intellectuals blow the sciences off as "nerdy" and "aloof," whereas the scientists often describe the literary intellectuals as "fuzzy" and "useless."  Because of this, the people who delve into literature do not know much at all about the sciences (and it can be argued that they actually do not know ANYTHING about it), and those who are more into the scientific pursuits read little to no literature.  Mind you, this book was written back in the 1950's, though the gap has considerably widened since then.  One reviewer on the Amazon website mentioned that the writer delves even deeper than the simple refusal to read anything from the other disciplines: he seems to delve a lot more into the issues of scientists having no moral compass, and the literary intellectuals not knowing how to fix the world even if they know that it is in a grave state.

In any case, the book came up while we were talking about how everyone in the college level should at least learn calculus, which I completely agree with; even if it is something that is largely "useless" to those who are studying literature, it is, at the very least, the cornerstone and almost a basic set of knowledge for the Western world.  It's a shame, however, that calculus classes nowadays are geared more toward engineers than mathematicians, which tends toward a setup of topics that are largely motivated in terms of its usefulness rather than its mathematical rigor.  Anyway, calculus does impart knowledge of mathematics that cannot be gleaned from simply studying elementary algebra, trigonometry, and geometry, and it also sums up a lot of the change of thinking that went on within the last 300 years in almost all of the sciences.

Getting back to the two other books, <u>Prime Obsession</u> seems to be an interesting layman's summary of the importance of the Riemann Zeta Function and Riemann's application of the function to analytic number theory.  The professor that I was talking to also mentioned that it has a lot to do with statistical distribution of the eigenvalues of a certain set of random matrices, which is extremely useful for analyzing random distributions of energies in a physical system.  The only problem, of course, is that the correlation between the distributions of the zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function and the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices is unproven; if it's disproved, then many huge fields of mathematics will be wiped out completely (mostly because there's a lot of mathematicians who ASSUME it's true without proof.)

<u>Riemann's Zeta Function</u> is a more technical treatise on the implications of the Riemann Zeta Function.  This is for the more hardened mathematician who wants to learn the inner workings of the function and its applicability to various problems in mathematics.

Anyway, it seems I have a lot of reading to do.]]></content:encoded>

I already exhausted my set of cigarettes and plan on not hanging outside the Allegro as much, since all people do out there is smoke anyway.  But yeah, I figure this should be easy, I've only been doing it for around three weeks, so I doubt I'll get the nausea that people get after staying away for like six hours.

But in any case, I figure I should be good by Friday or so.  That should take care of all of the nicotine in my body.

Hopefully this goes well.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I avoid watching TV.  I haven't watched TV in any real capacity for a couple of years now and found how degenerative it can be.  I hate saying this, but well, it also sickens me to see my family being more up to date with what's going on on TV than with what's going on around us.  Often, I cannot talk to them during dinner because the TV in the living room is on, their eyes glued to whatever is on the TV for the entire meal.

I find that I can't even communicate with some of my peers, since they spend a lot of time talking about what's on TV, as well as going as far as spewing out manufactured jokes from whatever TV series.  Maybe I'm out of touch with pop culture, though I don't really care too much, since I find conversations on what's actually going on around us to be much more interesting than talking about Survivor or whatever else.

The TV has a way of grabbing people's attentions to the point of causing anger and frustration when said attention is broken for even a fraction of a second.  "Can't miss any piece of the dialogue, the entire show will be ruined!"  No it won't, the shit is way too predictable no matter what sort of plot twists or inane quirks they throw in the wheel.

That's not to mention the effect it has on aesthetic, views on life and our humanity: we've come to the point where we simply want to delve into escapism and entertain ourselves with what's not in front of us but rather some sort of abstraction delivered via antenna direct to your TV screen.  Furthermore, our sense of style is derived almost completely from TV manufactured artificially rather than through natural social trends.

I guess all I'm saying is that for those who haven't stopped watching TV: stop.  I personally find more joy in talking to other people and prying for any inner wisdom that they might have - hopefully informed completely through their experiences rather than through a TV product - than watching TV.  I realize that TV isn't exactly THE problem in terms of whatever malaise our society might have, but getting rid of it seems to be the best way to regain a sense of connectedness to what's around us.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay, so I'm not even that far in the book (in fact, I'm still on chapter one, trying to clear every problem before reading the next chapter), but holy shit, what a hell of a first chapter.  Everything is lucid, the proofs of the theorems in the readings are clear, and most of all, the problem set is DIFFICULT, but also not impossible and is rich in its pedagogy.  It took me something like three hours to finally crack a problem where I had to prove that there is a unique x such that b^x = y (the old familiar base-b exponential function) without using any calculus whatsoever, but plain set theory, field axioms, and the bare minimum real number line properties (most importantly, the least upper bound property).  Everything is built from the ground up, though not in the extreme sense in terms of defining the natural numbers in terms of sets or whatever weird shit I sometimes hear about.

But yeah, I'm already loving the textbook.  Here's hoping the rest of the book is like the first chapter.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For those interested: <a href="http://be1man.blogspot.com/2007/08/community-is-mean-not-end.html">Original Post</a>

For those who don't know, I used to be a part of the "community," where it is in general a group of people who, well, want to get laid.  Yeah, I know, it sounds really retarded, but at the time, it seemed like a good idea.  As you can imagine, most have inept social skills, some desperate, and all completely oblivious to the idiocy of the "community."  I mostly joined this "community" in order to improve my own social skills and not to "pick up women," though I found that the "community" was simply an example on ineptness rather than the glowing beacon that the people in the "community" claimed it was; in other words, it provided an easy reference point that exemplified what NOT to do in the future.  In any case, after leaving the "community," I've since become a lot more social and made a lot of good friends along the way.

The fallacy of thinking that something that must be experienced can be reduced down to bits of advice put into words is the basis of the community; the people in the community think that you can simply go around the obstacle of experiencing necessary events and growing pains in order to become more social and to "get laid," which, while it can at least give the illusion of it working, it is, in reality, a very unstable foundation.

Anyway, on to my response and reflection:

Being at peace with ourselves as a means to becoming more social is definitely something I agree with.  If we are uncomfortable with ourselves, we cannot be comfortable in any situation.  We must accept ourselves fully in order to present ourselves to others in the most genuine way possible.  Being social seems to come naturally as a corollary to being at peace with ourselves, though we also, in some cases, cannot ever be at peace until we throw ourselves into social situations and eventually learn to be at peace.

We should approach social situations as a means to get to genuinely know people rather than as a battleground where we have to deliver banter line here, neg there, etc. etc.  Everyone's got something to say, it's just a matter of prying it out of their heads and appreciating it, even if there's disagreement.

Here's where I disagree with the post: why try to be the fun guy (which, according to the post, is essential to making friends) when you can simply accept the fact that you can't be fun all the time?  Personally, I can have a lot of fun in various situations, but at other times, I speak my mind in a very serious manner and still be fine with everyone.  Maybe he's instead trying to hint at always having a positive attitude that lends to being fun, which I do agree with.

I'll wrap this up with the best piece of advice that many misunderstand and throw away: be yourself.  Yes, a lot of people in the community say that "being yourself" never worked for them and think, in some circles, that that is probably the WORST piece of advice that they can ever follow.  Well, my suggestion in this case if you can't follow the advice is to FIND yourself and to be more social.  Find "normal" people to talk to, those who are outside any subcultures or communities.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ian, as always, I like your refinement of what I wrote... be a fun guy is about being positive, being happy, and being good company to those around myself.  You probably have your share of experience with people who are like vampires, they suck the life force out of you.  That's not being a "fun guy" or a guy having fun.  Going out should be fun, period.  If someone isn't enjoying what s/he is doing, then s/he should stop doing that.  Life is too short to wallow in unhappy, sad, depressed state.  We don't have that long to live!

This is called blog pinging... we can write a whole blog about blogging off ea other's posts!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay, so I decided to watch an episode or two while my brother was watching it on the TV.  My brother says this is the best show EVER, while I look on and witness clichÃ© plot twists, cliffhangers, and crappy dialogue.

Case in point:

Dude - "I want to buy this ring for my wife"
Jeweler - "YOU DON'T WANT TO, YOU WILL BE ON AN ISLAND INSTEAD, I KNOW EVERYTHING"
Dude - "NOOOOOOO"

This... is network TV genius?  Are you fucking kidding me?  I was talking to my brother about this and said that good films in general are, in general, considered art, whereas this garbage cannot possibly be art.

Wait, why can't it be art?

Because it's network TV, they always want slick writers that use common techniques that draw people in without really adding any substance at all, which means more money for the TV company.

Anyway, I guess my main point is that all of you Lost fans suck too for liking Lost.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've typed up my resumÃ© for the coffee shop, which I'll hand in tomorrow morning.  I figure I can schedule myself for now as full time at the help desk job, then maybe change my schedule later if at all possible.  If not, I'll just work full time during the weekdays and maybe work five hours during the weekend over at the Allegro.

As a sidenote, I listened in to a help desk call last Friday which had a Filipino dude on the other end (it was way too obvious by the accent that he was Filipino.)  I asked my dad if he knew the guy that called in, and well, funnily enough, it's one of his good friends.  Weird how that worked out...

I really hope they don't make us stay the whole day on Monday, since the training schedule says that we are only there from 9:00 - 10:30 AM.  That shit sucked on Friday.  Shadowing for five hours straight is not fun, especially when there are practically no calls coming in.

I've been sketching a lot lately as well.  I've tons of rough sketches in my notebook, the same one that I use for solving math problems from that damned Rudin text.  I figure that since I'm starting the math and art stuff on opposite ends of the notebook, there could be some weird freakish art/math clash that I will draw in the middle once I fill the notebook up.  Aww yeah.

Yep, that's about it really for now.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've loads of crap that I've gotta sort through in my head, but well, I'll try to talk about them in some capacity.

First up is media theory.  An old dude that I ran into over at Allegro talked a lot about Marshall McLuhan, who is the sole founder of media theory and is the originator of the infamous quote, "the media is the message"; that is, he states in part that it does not even matter what is said, what matters in general is the medium in which the statements are communicated through.  This somewhat explains why politics and many things in general are tending toward cleaning up the image rather than the policy, because no one cares about what is said, but rather the image that is presented.  McLuhan says that TV lends itself to an audience who does not pay attention after six or seven minutes, and therefore, the medium has an intrinsic property that lends itself to a more superficial presentation of information, namely, a presentation dependent on image that hooks viewers rather than anything substantial.

Second, religion.  I myself have been trying to read a bit of Tao Te Ching here and there, though I'm not sure if I would really consider it a religion even it's often listed as one.  I'm pretty sure I've noted that a while ago, but I've been also been reflecting upon some of the things that I would've looked at with any other lens and see that a lot of things have started to become clear, namely, the concept of success and failure.  Failure is seen as a terrible state to be in, something where if you want to find yourself in a better spot in life, you'll have to learn from that failure and be sure that you don't fall in the same rut again.  Similarly, success is an ideal state to be in and it should be pursued as much as possible.  However, at least through the lens of Taoism, both states are complimentary and, dare I say it, inherently meaningless.  That is, failure is very much on an equal plane as success, yet if we are talking about Taoism, failure and success are completely foreign concepts that are only evident largely in Western societies.  Thus, stripping away the connotations of failure and success will lead to a greater understanding of the dynamics in which the two concepts are complimentary.

Oh, and I was talking to a coworker of mine about monotheistic religions, mostly Catholicism and Protestantism.  Apologies in advance if you Protestants are offended, but a lot of Protestant sects seem to rely mostly on evangelicalism versus intellectualism, which is what the Catholic Church espouses.  On top of that, the Catholic Church is often much more accepting and tolerant of everyone, though they do try to lead those who choose to investigate Catholicism toward becoming a Catholic and truly understanding what must be changed, what virtues must be learned, etc.  Protestantism, on the other hand, is highly exclusionary and will simply shove everyone who does not fit a certain image out of the way and will also denigrate their being.

I don't really have much more insights to give on what my coworker said, other than the fact that it's highly interesting.  Maybe I'll have a cup of coffee outside of work with him sometime, I'm definitely interested in hearing more.

Uh... let's see... I went to a bar with a friend of mine earlier this evening.  The place is called "The Hop Vine," which had open mic and a bunch of classy beers on tap (Rogue Shakespeare Stout is fucking good, I have to say.)  My friend also ended up playing his guitar on open mic, which was great to see.  I met a few people he knew, namely his former guitar teacher from SU and a mutual friend.  It was good times, though I should've brought my pack of smokes, since I ended up bumming cigarettes from four or five different people throughout the night.

Y'know, when I was talking to that old violin dude last night over at Allegro, I noticed that there was an ambulance that sat in the Allegro parking lot with its engine on.  The old guy went to the ambulance and told them to turn off their engine, to which they replied that they are there because they get "good wifi" in the parking lot.  Hah.  A great summary of our society at large, if you ask me. :p

I don't know what else to say.  That's pretty much what's been happening over the past few days.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As you all probably know, I've been meaning to work at CafÃ© Allegro for a while.  I've turned in my resumÃ© earlier this week as a sort of reaction to the current job I'm doing at Computing & Communications at the UW; it's a decent job, I just simply cannot stand the environment.  In any case, I've heard from the grapevine that Nathaniel (the owner) either does not look at the resumÃ©s or he simply skims through them but prefers to talk to potential applicants face to face.

In any case, I've been meaning to talk to Nathaniel for a while, but since he usually only works morning shifts, I rarely, if ever, get to catch him before he leaves.  However, I lucked out a few days ago: I was hanging out outside of the coffee shop with coffee in hand when Nathaniel shows up from wherever he came from.  I stood up and told him that I submitted my application and that I wanted to talk to him about me possibly working in the coffee shop.  We sat down on the bench and dived into what was to be one of the best and quite possibly the most humbling conversations that I've had so far.  I've found out from our conversation that he has a very humble perspective on life.  He relates to anyone and everyone that walks around the area, basks in the precious moment that he has when talking to others, and relishes it as if it was the only gold nugget that he had ever set eyes on.  He realizes that everyone does their own thing and that we should simply accept it as how it is, even if they're in a hurry and doesn't like conversation (which is an example that I brought up in our talk).  His coffee shop is his most prized possession, with the cracked ground laid in front with cigarette butts strung all over the place being his sacred ground; the "parlor" in front of the cashier and barista being his living room; the conversations, his currency.

He mentioned that he tries to follow Taoism himself, which seems to make a lot of sense, now that I think about it.  He told me of a book he read about a potential business mogul who fell from grace and lost everything that he had owned, as well as had to accept the fact that he would be in poverty for the rest of his life.  However, he ended up finding joy in sweeping the street in front of a certain store for his entire life, doing the same routine every day, even if it irritated the customers inside of the store.  But he thought of nothing else but the task at hand, because that's all that was important at that moment.

Accepting whatever is at hand and treasuring every moment is something that I'm still working on, but is what Nathaniel has already seemingly mastered.

Anyway, I took an early lunch break today in order to see if I could catch Nathaniel and see if he thought about giving me a job.  He hasn't really thought about it much, since there were returning baristas who had greater priority than new applicants, which is no problem at all.

I then asked him if he calls applicants to tell them if they got the job or not.

"No, I usually don't.  It's all happenstance."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I got a 0.0 GPA in my Topology class.  EXCELLENT!!!!

I at least learned A LOT about how to actually prove shit and a lot of stuff about topology in general.  It was my first real intensive math class that I've had since I've transferred to the UW (the other two introductory to real analysis courses, 327 and 328, were intensive as well, but the professors weren't nearly as anal about how to construct proofs from first principles, not to mention that I didn't have to rewrite assignments five times over.)  The 400 level class I took at Seattle University (Abstract Algebra I) didn't even give me a taste on how much of an ass kicking I would receive in this class.

In any case, I guess I have to lay off the Allegro for a bit during the school year and actually use my time effectively.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(NOTE: I'm not religious at all.  It could possibly be construed that I am from this post, but... yeah, I'm not. :p)

I've heard a lot of positions based around doing an act that is typically against the precepts of various religions by using the argument that we are simply being "human": since we have natural impulses to, say, have sex with multiple partners or to move from partner to partner when the passion dies down, it is natural and is possibly morally ambiguous (versus strictly morally wrong or right) to act upon said impulses.

I somewhat accepted this explanation and went along my way, though I still thought that following some sort of philosophy or religion would be the best way to refine one's views on these various hot issues.  However, in a conversation I had a while ago, the guy I was talking to brought up a really good point about this issue: he said that there is not a single "base humanity" that we all follow, but rather, there are in reality different "levels" of humanity.  For instance, acting upon sexual impulses right away would lend itself to a more instinctual and baser styling of humanity, while humbling yourself and helping others with compassion would hint toward a higher sense of humanity that require us to override our instincts.

Thus, it could be argued that the precepts of religions are not exactly "anti-human" as some would argue, but rather, are higher levels of humanity that require an "overriding" of the lower levels of humanity (or I guess, a subduing of our baser instincts).

I suppose some of the things that people see in religions or whatever else are the hypocrites: the hypocrites are the ones who obfuscate the higher levels of humanity and steer people's intuition from that to the baser levels of self-gain, deceit, and impulsiveness.

Anyway, I suppose what I'm trying to say is that while there are natural tempting things to do as a part of our natural humanity, we do not have to follow them necessarily, because it's not the ONLY level of humanity that we can follow.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've always tooled around with this question in my head every now and then: will I be able to sever myself from technology - or at least interconnectivity through electronic means - within the near future?

We've become enamored by the technologies and mediums that have been introduced into our society within the past one hundred years.  However, it is like an invasive parasite on our psyches that has manifested itself in all levels of societies, young and old alike.  In fact, we are introduced to these technologies when we are little kids, training us to become proficient in the art of communication in a contemporary age, where we communicate by means of phone, internet, and other sorts of mediums that add physical - and most importantly, emotional - distance between the two parties.

This has a profound effect on the way our society is shaped.  Perhaps it is of no coincidence that Seattle, my hometown, is one of the most wired cities in the country, whereas at the same time, is also well known for its coldness in human interactions (see: Seattle Freeze).

Since our entire society is now based mostly around our communicative technologies - namely, the cell phone and the internet - it is tough to throw it away entirely.  We will always encounter a societal construct that is based around this fact, which expects a type of interaction with it that requires participation motivated by our usage of the communicative medium.  However, we can ween ourselves away from these mediums little by little until we can redirect the mediums effects on our lives toward trivialities.  But it seems that we can't ever escape it, and we shouldn't expect to escape it; humans in a society act within the society, not outside nor separate from it.

Perhaps exercising other mediums of communication, like for instance, two way face to face communication, will help destroy our reliance on technology and will ultimately free us from any a-posteriori effects that these technologies have on our society.

Thoughts, anyone?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(this is mostly a paraphrasing of McLuhan's analysis of the effects of media with a few comments on how it relates to our society today)

McLuhan: "Socially, it is the accumulation of group pressures and irritations that prompt invention and innovation as counter-irritants."

To relate to contemporary society, we are shocked both physiologically and psychologically when we find that we have little to no celebrity status amongst our peers, or when we fail terribly at social life that we end up in a downward spiral.  Some try to compensate for the metaphorical hole in our chests through activities that either provide another outlet for celebrity (like for instance, Youtube), or anything else that would numb the shock that has overridden our senses in our body (playing online games, chatting on discussion forums, etc.)  In essence, we have a tendency to "autoamputate" the senses that have been shocked through extensions that numb the senses, like for instance, the wheel to the foot; the wheel's nature lends itself to numbing the foot's existence by making the foot do a repetitive rotating motion or, today, abstract the wheel from the foot even further by making the foot do an action that is not directly related to the wheel's movement.

When we do not have such faculties available for autoamputation, we look for other ways to quell our irritations and nausea when we are shocked and are put into a situation where we must compensate through numbing our senses.  The noises of city life for instance, a cacophonous combination of chatter and various other noises, requires a reharmonization that quells our irritation of the dissonance around us.  To counter this irritant, the Walkman was invented.  We also have people on the streets that carry their guitars around and play them for money, because they know that people need this sort of reharmonization in order to quell their irritations.  Now, we have iPods and other MP3 devices that have considerably lowered the amount of chatter in the city, yet it seems that we have also, in effect, "detribalized" ourselves.

(A quick aside: I was on the 28 Metro bus heading back to my house from school trying to read a book.  I had my earphones on while listening to my iPod, which then it occurred to me after I looked up that everyone else was doing the same thing; I then removed my earphones and had a much quieter environment in which to read in.  Ahh, the joys of the damned iPod.)

Much like our autoamputative response to any physiological shock to our bodies (when we fall unexpectedly one or two feet down from a ledge, our bodies tend to numb the pain right away until we return to normal), we have autoamputative responses to psychological shocks in the form of technological extensions of our bodies.

Perhaps this lends itself to a hint to the question that I posed earlier: will I be able to sever myself from technology?  Maybe it is impossible, since it is now almost a permanent extension to my body as it is for everyone else; the nausea that permeates society is quelled by technology, and so, we have dependence toward our devices in order to properly numb the shocks that we experience otherwise.  The socially not-so-acclimated man would have to retreat behind technology or other extensions of the body in order to save face; because of the inventions that have been developed since computers have arrived on the scene, he may delve into online games where he can communicate in a certain language that is not necessarily socially acceptable anywhere else, or maybe delve into hobbies that provide comfort and do not require social participation, etc.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We act within our society and never outside of it.  There is no escape from the collective thought patterns and perceptions borne within the people in a given society.

To elaborate: our actions and thoughts are motivated purely by what's around us.  We grow up in a way that is quite similar to the way anyone else would grow up in our overall society.

When we grow up in a society with others, we don't necessarily have the same answers or ask the same questions on various topics between ourselves; the main thing to note, however, is the fact that there are questions that are NOT thought of at all within a society, mainly because we approach subjects in a certain manner that do not reveal much of the other possible questions.  In other words, we are first born with an unhampered vision of what's around us, though our vision increasingly narrows for every minute we spend in our newfound environment as the biases in the presentation of the environment - through language and other means - starts to seep into our perception of the world until our perception bias matches the biases within the presentation itself.

All of the above gets me to my next point: when we ask questions specifically on human nature, we typically answer in whatever way is natural for all of us living in our own society.  For instance, a lot of people here in the United States would say that man is, by nature, individualistic and greedy.  People that live in a more family/group oriented society would probably say that humans tend to group together for the common good; that is, the atomic unit of human groups varies between cultures rather than it being a constant.  Thus, there is no ingenuity when one thinks of rebellion in an individualistic society, as the same as there would be no ingenuity when one ponders about becoming socially conservative in a more group oriented society; these biases and behaviors are all to be expected!

I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's no use in thinking that there is uniqueness in a society, that we can rebel and see results (though the issue of the "rebel without a cause" can be another discussion altogether), that universal human nature is based around a trait that is true only in a certain type of society, etc.

Yep.  More later.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm grasping at straws at a time when I really need to grab onto a few rocks and get myself out of this damned situation I'm in right now.  I am fucked.  I am in all ways messed up.

I've walked up and down The Ave for God knows how many times, mostly trying to figure shit out and throw other thoughts out of my mind.

I need solitude.  I have to distract myself somehow.  I have to get away from everything.

God dammit!  I don't know what to do.  Maybe I just need time.  More fucking time.  And also more restraint, just fucking... restraint.

I just wish I could show anyone, just anyone, the other god damned side of me, the side where I tuck away a lot of bullshit.  I keep my composure most of the time, but a lot of times, I simply cannot talk to anyone and have to walk around for half an hour or so before I'm alright.  But I can't even tell my parents about this shit, I can't tell any of my friends about this shit, etc. etc.  I have to keep it all inside.  And I'm tired of it.  I have to let it go.  It's gotten to the point where I just have so much god damned dirty garbage that has to be thrown away from my body.

I'm... I'm not myself.  I'm not myself.  I need help.  I'm fucked up.  I'm really fucked up.

I don't know.  I apologize for the heated narcissistic rant above.  Just give me time.  I'll be back to my old self soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey,

Just some suggestions here and take them for whatever they are worth.

Find someone you can confide in and talk about the things that are bothering you.  It's very important.  A sibling or a close friend.

If you don't want to do that, consider going to a psychotherapist; it's all confidential so you can trust this person.  I go to a therapist for anxiety and it's immensely helpful.  There might be some service like that offered through your school, so it might not be as expensive as what you might think...then again, can you really put a price on mental health.  Do whatever you can to get back to your old self.

Distraction is good...movies, music, TV, friends, whatever you can do to make yourself feel some enjoyment.  Also, I think exercise is good, go for a run and get some endorphins going through your system.

Just know that you'll pull out of this funk.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For those who don't know, Radiohead is releasing their new album, "<a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/Store/Quickindex.html">In Rainbows</a>," on the internet.  They are offering both a box set for 40 pounds (which is equivalent to $80+, though it comes with two vinyl LPs, two CD's with one having extra songs that isn't included in the digital download as well as other stuff) and a digital download for... whatever price you wish to put on it.  Awesome deal, though I'm sure most people will put either 0 pounds or the least amount of money that it would take to get the entire album.

I myself am putting in 0.5 pounds in for the album because I'm fucking cheap.

This should be an amazing album.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[American politics nowadays is very shortsighted and is filled with blind idealism and whatever else; or perhaps I should say, our thoughts on current American politics today is very idealistic and is pretty much the same between any other person in the Democratic/Republican party.  This somewhat goes along with the overall trend of society matched with uniformity that is cemented within the consumerist ideals; in other words, our thoughts have increasingly become uniform as consumerism took hold on our society, along with the introduction of TV as a major medium of entertainment.  This has huge implications on the way we think about politics where it is now more about showmanship and circus acts on TV and on stage of the general societal theater of America.

I was somewhat talking (well, more like listening) to two guys debating about intervention in countries such as Darfur, Iraq and Burma.  One person was debating along the lines of, "the only reason why we protest the invasion of Iraq is because it's Bush," whereas the other person said something along the lines of, "why go into Iraq, we should intervene in Darfur, Burma, etc."  After the latter person had to go, I talked a bit with the other guy.  He made a great point that I agree with completely: we should simply let them figure it out on their own since they have a completely different political/social lineage than we do.  To add to that, we should let them deal with it on their own since, in general, the forceful thrusting of ideals eventually falls apart due to the lack of hindsight on how the culture operates, e.g., Vietnam, Russia, Iraq, etc.  The thrusting of democracy or even the meddling in the affairs of other countries will send them closer to a quagmire due to the shock of ideals that was not borne from a natural manifestation of ideas.

Maybe one thing to note, if only going on anecdotal evidence, is that successful transformations of society and political thought is unconscious.  That is, our creation of a representative democracy was inevitable due to the overall climate of European government as well as geographical separation.

It is not necessarily bad to have a more "primitive" form of government, nor is it necessarily good to always have a democracy forcefully implemented.  The only way a successful democracy is born is through an overall unconscious movement toward those ends.

This is also the reason why I think direct intervention of Darfur, Burma, etc. is not necessarily the best thing to do.  In the sense of the American view of what we ought to do when poor looking people are in trouble, it's an easy choice of throwing military at the problem and defend the poor looking people from the oppressors.  However, when we do that, we also go there with a stained perspective; again, we only look through the American lens, so our view of humanitarian aid is very "Sally Struthers-like"; our humanitarian action is another's meddling in political affairs, and so we end up in a quagmire that starts off with two sides totally polarized with one obviously supporting the Americans, and then it starts to level off and both groups start to equally dislike our presence.

To take other events from history, we can look at the European Imperialist period where the European powers divided Africa up between themselves and pushed Western ideas and technologies onto the peoples of these countries, who have had no true natural development of its society that would accommodate such drastic changes.  The technology and ideals forcefully thrown into these countries have created nationalism in a country that had no such preconceived notions of such an idea, divisions within countries, shifting of the atomic familial unit, etc.  The forceful shock of an idea or technology creates divisions between people; a sort of "detribalizing," as McLuhan would put it.

In any case, if you're wondering why I'm so apathetic to politics, read the above.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I should read some of Kierkegaard's works sometime.

I read a little bit of his works in one of my philosophy classes back in Seattle University, though I never really got into it.  We mention Kierkegaard quite a bit in passing in my Philosophy of Religion class as a sort of third opinion on whatever analytical methods we use to try deducing various things about God, religion, etc.

And now I'm really interested in reading Kierkegaard.  Why?  His views on faith depend on a "suspension of doubt," where we leap in even if the religion might be very wrong in its underpinnings.  An example that my professor brought up is a person running into a burning house with little chance of him surviving with an even lower chance of him finding anyone alive inside the house, yet he runs in with faith that he will be able to find someone who is alive and can try to save him.  It's irrational, but it's the transcendence of logic that makes one have faith in God.

In any case, there still should be logical underpinnings for at least the reasoning why one ought to have faith in God, since we often run into the problem of circular reasoning ("Yes, I kneel and bow because I believe in God.  Why do I believe in God?  Because I kneel and bow"), as well as blind belief without totally "leaping into faith."

But yeah, the reason why I'm more inclined to lean toward Kierkegaard's philosophy is because God escapes all reason, and to place a logical framework on faith is to completely destroy the essence of faith.  I also think that while science provides a great framework in creating models that are backed up by falsifiable research, it does not provide a complete view of the truth as it exists outside of the frameworks of science, since empirical research is inherently biased toward our unique mode of interpreting the world.

Eh, who knows, I titled this blog post with today's date since my views on religion shifts every now and then, so be sure to keep a look out for "Views on religion as of 11/04/07/." :)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was talking to an Ethiopian friend of mine today about how people live their lives in certain societal ecologies; for instance, in his home country, it is typical and natural for an 18 year old son in an agricultural area to go out and build his hut, raise animals, plant seeds, get a wife, etc.  It is a very simple life that is characterized by the amounts of space he has between him and the next house, the sorts of worries and tribulations he must tend to, etc.  In an agricultural area, there are not many worries except to tend to these livestock and food items in order to sustain his family.

However, in an urban environment, everyone is stacked on top and around each other, everything is uniform, there are many more worries, etc.  The only way to survive is to separate from the family unit, but it is of no smooth natural consequence; rather, it is a sort of wrestling around with the idea of Darwinism in an urban context and trying to create a role not in the familial unit but under the tutelage of an overseer of a business.

These sorts of human-made environmental configurations lends itself to drastic societal differences; the countryside, at least in some areas perhaps, is producer based and is more family based due to the expansiveness and traditional "grandfathering" of the land.  The urban center is known for its density and restriction of movement; this lends itself to a more uniform and individualist societal configuration.  The urban center also offers more specialist jobs that is not directly associated with the survival of the family - that is, they are not producing directly for the family, but rather earning money and buying things from a shopping center - which leads to the uniformity and increase of education of the people occupying the city.  The city, mind you, was born out of the industrial revolution, which required specialist roles for a job that serves someone outside of the family unit, versus the more well-rounded roles of people living in an agricultural area that directly serves the family unit; in the latter case, the family has a stronger pull as the atomic unit of a society versus individuals, though the strength of the pull definitely varies between countries.

However, we, who are mostly born from the city, have to accept the fact that we are generally separated from everyone else, and that there is nothing we can do about it.  The combination of specialization, higher education, density of population, capitalism, etc. lends to separation, as mentioned before.

Here are two fairly insightful quotes by Murray Bookchin that I found on Wikipedia while searching for "social ecology," whose works I should probably should read sometime:

"The notion that man must dominate nature emerges directly from the domination of man by manâ¦ But it was not until organic community relationsâ¦ dissolved into market relationships that the planet itself was reduced to a resource for exploitation. This centuries-long tendency finds its most exacerbating development in modern capitalism. Owing to its inherently competitive nature, bourgeois society not only pits humans against each other, it also pits the mass of humanity against the natural world. Just as men are converted into commodities, so every aspect of nature is converted into a commodity, a resource to be manufactured and merchandised wantonly."

"The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital."

Perhaps to solve the problem of the "plundering of the human spirit" is to find a community markedly different from the rest of the environment, however rare that may be.  I'm probably hinting at CafÃ© Allegro again, but well, the exchange of conversation with no other intention but to learn of the other person and to try capturing the essence of their humanity is probably exactly what we need to get ourselves back on track; throwing away dominion and power games will, hopefully, allow us to finally treat human interactions as it is rather than as capital.

Otherwise, we accept what we have and appreciate life without aspiring for something great, which also implies that we should not fear the crashing of ambitions.  The aspiration of something great is the capitalist trap.  However, as someone else that I've talked to said, we mix up Eastern Philosophies with Western nihilism, which is yet another trap that we have to avoid.  To go along with simply living without aspiration is nihilism, while appreciating everything without aspiration points toward (probably) Buddhism or Taoism.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't think the only way to survive is to separate from the family unit.  If alienation from the surrounding city is significant, it might be in one's favor to stick with family for social support...it's better to be part of a team (however you might define team: family, friends, etc) rather than trying to do everything for oneself.

You might tend to think of things as becoming specialized and therefore becoming isolated, eg like the specialization of jobs in a society.  I would invite you to think more about how this makes people more interconnected, interdependent in the economic sense (not so much interconnected in the psychological sense!...read into Marx's views on the modes of alienation as a consequence of capitalist economies.)

Your line of thinking lends itself to more socialist tendencies.  It sounds like it originates from some kind of negative feeling about city living.  There are some positive things about the city, I don't think I need to point those out to you.

Something simplistic to say to you: it's not all bad.

Also, I do agree with your allusions to the negative side of capitalism: the obsession with property, the reduction of people to mere consumers and producers.

I'd be interested to understand what you would consider an ideal society.  Have you read Plato's Republic?  He constructed an ideal society based on an analysis of human nature.  He/Socrates advocated an aristocracy/meritocracy.  The funny thing is, after all the arguments and counter-arguments, Socrates admits that in his ideal society, there must exist a lie which ought to be perpetuated: that people are fundamentally of a particular class.  In order for there to be stability, people must be able to accept the ideology that they belong to a particular class (I think he divided them among gold, silver, and bronze).  He even goes into details about how the ruling class needs to allow the Noble Lie to permeate the culture: he says something about how it will take at least 2-3 generations until their idea can be accepted by most people...after that, the Noble Lie will be so ingrained in the culture that they will have achieved stability, and the lie will perpetuate itself.  Interesting read.  Anyway, what's your ideal society?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[(first of all, sorry for the late response, i've been meaning to respond to this for a while now but haven't ever gotten around to it)

that's the thing, it will naturally progress to an eventual disintegration of the family unit as the individual becomes more and more specialized and more and more individualistic.  the want and need to stay with the family is of course the more favorable thing to go for, but again, it is societal movement and influences that really determines the family unit and how cohesive it is (of course, immigrants will have very tight knit families, 2nd generations will be more accustomed to the american way of life, etc.)  the amount of want that someone would have to stay within a family and be as closely knit as possible is totally up to the person and the way that they are raised, but the concept would eventually not even occur to the 4th generation citizen living in a future, more individualistic, society.

the specialization of roles, of course, would still need something to tie everything together to make the cohesive whole.  however, this is to replace the artisan, who would've had command over all "specialized roles" a thousand years ago.  thus, since the whole requires the parts to be a product, it's natural to think that the parts would have to depend on each other in one sense or another.  and, this specialization, the uniformity and repetitiveness of these roles, diminish the creativity and variety that a man could assume in an industrial society; the artisan was psychologically secure in a lot of ways, more so than the specialized man constructing thousands upon thousands of the same piece in the whole.  why?  because his faculties were unrestricted and he had the freedom to express his humanity into his product.

eh, i suppose my views do somewhat lean toward socialist tendencies, though i don't quite think communism nor socialism could ever be implemented in this day and age.  so well, capitalism must be accepted, as dehumanizing as it can be.

modern cities have their benefits and distinct cultures that are fresh and are very human, though i believe we won't find them in the richer communities.  nevertheless, the sociological impact cities have on the psyche seems to be quite profound, which is something i still want to research on sometime in the near future.

an ideal society?  perhaps... one run by philosopher kings who have found the world of ideas. :D  (i've read only the allegory of the cave in... republic i think)

err, on a more serious note, i suppose a... yeah, more socialist society would be a bit ideal, though more tacked onto the capitalist society we have now.  however, this will be an outrageous suggestion since capitalism is very opposed to this idea: remove advertisements and TV.  then we'd have my more ideal society. :)

the noble lie idea seems very interesting btw, i'll have to look into that.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was talking to my brother's coworker last night outside of a bar in Belltown about various things, mostly touching upon how we take a lot of things for granted in this country.  We have an abundance of convenience where we have multiple choices of everything (and in great quantities) and are therefore spoiled by the sheer availability of goods.  The mere thought of having one of something is very disgusting to us, as that implies that we are not cashing in in our abundance and in our "right to choose" whatever we want.  On top of that, we want things instantly without much hassle and wait.  This convenience is, again, in great abundance; businesses compete along the lines of convenience and abundance of features and things when marketing to the consumer, and since we gear these products toward consumers, we also try our hardest to CONVINCE them, somehow, that this is a great thing to have and that this partaking in our abundant conveniences will somehow improve their life in some way.

Since we are spoiled by such abundances of convenience, we also tend to apply the same concept to interpersonal relationships.  We want people to be available whenever possible.  An extreme but not all that uncommon example of this sort of behavior is when we gain a friendship, "use" the friendship until it wears out, then discard it as if it were a piece of outdated furniture.  Advice on how to improve one's life typically include something about removing all of those people in their life who bog them down or simply retooling the friendship to their needs.  A very hedonistic and narcissistic concept, but it is indeed something that is prevalent in American society.

Individualism, by itself, is as great of a concept as tribalism, but when twisted by a force that ensnares people and throws the "individualism" out of the window yet puts it back in as a smoke screen, it becomes something very nasty and selfish.  Even if we can, in some respects, make our own free choices, when we're sedated with having all of these conveniences, we become uniformly lazy and uniformly apathetic, though through the lens of "free choice" by means of freely choosing material goods, we mistakenly believe that we are, indeed, making a free choice.  The illusion of "free choice" when dealing with material goods is simply ensnaring us further with visuals and advertisement; we value more the presentation than survivability.  When we are in a society with only one of each type of foods in a given store, we end up valuing these goods even more; when we desire something more luxurious, we'd have to toil to find this item in another market, even if this "more luxurious" thing is simply another equal, "free" choice in American society.

Does quantity of goods (as well as quantity of choices) necessarily correlate with uniformity?  Probably not, though it seems to become much more relevant as an influencing force when we turn toward consumption rather than production and direct bartering.  The fluctuation of quantities and choices directly affect our psyches and our temperament toward a particular business, and thus, when one business does not provide, we go to another, and if that doesn't provide, we go to yet another business, etc.  In short, we as a people are directly affected by the economies of material goods; when we don't see choice, we take our dollar elsewhere, like what any other good capitalist would do.  However, in other societies, we have to live off of what we have because there are no other choices, which, while inconvenient, is also humanizing, since it also ties communities together when there are shortages of a particular good, in which the entire community must cooperate with each other in order to satiate our needs for these goods.

Again, as my brother's coworker said, we're fortunate to have the fortune of plenty, but in another light, is also a curse.  And also, unfortunately, as I've mentioned a thousand times before in my previous blog posts, it's also impossible to escape this influence unless we break away from our society and implant ourselves in another.]]></content:encoded>

Well with the amount of music you currently have can you recommend someone who sounds like the X-Ecutioners or any other fast paced electronica/hip-hop? Turntablists are a plus.

I'm creating a slide show from all the pictures I've been taking with the new SLR that will be uploaded to YouTube soon for a contest.

Btw...still haven't had a chance to purchase those headphones but will get on it soon man. Thanks.]]></wp:comment_content>

for more electronica based stuff that has a tinge of hip-hop in it, daedelus is great.  there's also DJ shadow, who, with his earlier albums at least, falls more under the realm of trip-hop.

sweet, link me once the video's uploaded btw.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The urban middle class is slowly becoming more and more dehumanized as time goes on.  Charity, for instance, is a great example of the dehumanization of the middle class: we are absolutely fine with throwing change at a random homeless guy and writing huge checks to whatever organization for charity, yet on the same token, we will shun away any other homeless person that we don't have the mood to give money to.  All of you have probably heard it before: "they can just find a shelter and a food bank, they don't need anything from me," "this guy is way too dirty for me to do anything for him," etc.  If we view the homeless as sources of altruism, we institutionalize them into a pigeon hole and completely neglect their unique experiences as humans.

And, when we, the middle class, contribute to charitable causes, we obtain something very valuable to us: the feel good gut feeling of greatness.  Yes, the feel good gut feeling of greatness is highly valued because we often do not feel this sensation in any other instance, yet it's quite predictable that we will feel this when we contribute goods and money, and so we try to do this more often and more consistently when in fact we are cementing the pigeon hole that we have created by categorizing the homeless as sources of altruism.  There is, in effect, still a barrier between us and the homeless even if we directly contribute to a charitable cause.

On a larger scale, the American sense of charity fits right into the notion of Capitalism: we effectively barter with our economy when we contribute toward charity, since our government offers tax breaks, the organization we contributed to offers the sense of celebrity, and we lend ourselves the preprogrammed sense of the feel good gut feeling.  There is no net loss, we all gain from it, and it's, in general, still an equal bargain.  We are also quite aware of it, yet we say otherwise.

Oh, and this is my most favorite thing about this whole construct: it also offers social escalation, or, in the very least, a sense of artificial escalation.  We tend to look down upon those who do not contribute charity for any sort of reason, as if they were directly responsible for the lack of food for the poor kids on the streets, or the slaughter of babies in Darfur, or whatever.

Maybe it's because of that soft speaking person on the other side of the TV screen when kids from Africa appear on the screen, or perhaps the piano playing in the background... I don't know.  In any case, the imagery offers a feeling of contributing "all good," and so, anyone who is against contributing "good" is "bad."

I'll probably write a new post sometime in the future about how institutions in general dehumanize our societies, especially middle/upper class constructs.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well well, here's my tentative schedule for Winter 2008:

MATH 403 (Introduction to Modern Algebra II): 9:30 - 10:20 AM, MWF
MATH 425 (Foundations of Analysis II): 11:30 AM - 12:20 PM, MWF
GERMAN 102: 12:30 - 1:20 PM, M-F
CHID 205 (Methods and Imagination): 1:30 - 2:30 PM, M-F

CHID 205 should be great, I've heard that though it covers many philosophers and writers, it is NOT a simple overview class, which I'm really happy about.  It's also very much focused on philosophy though it is under the CHID designation, so that is great as well, though I'm also disappointed that it won't really count toward a philosophy major.

In any case, I'm sucking in my two math classes right now (MATH 402 and MATH 424) and I really really hope I at least pass them so I can move on to the next set of classes.  I've just been doing terribly in all of my classes this quarter due to just being totally unmotivated (though I DO want to do well in these classes, it's just mostly this quarter where I've been totally removed from my school work in general.)

Here's hoping I'll do okay in this quarter so I don't get my financial aid cut off.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Questions to ask myself:

<ul>
<li>Where do I stand in life?</li>
<li>What am I doing?</li>
<li>How do I go back to being an ignorant fuck?</li>
<li>Why am I falling for the same person again and again and again?  And why am I constantly confused when I fall, get back up, fall, get back up, fall...?</li>
<li>What's my next step?  Should I stay in school or should I drift around and find, for sure (I hope), what I should do with myself?</li>
</ul>

God dammit.  When will I get out of this bullshit in my head?  I can't remember the last time I've had any lasting happiness, and this worries me.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I went out and studied a little with my ex and her friend today.

Then she dropped the bomb: she doesn't want to go into a relationship with me because of some "unresolved issues."

And, because I'm a fucking retard, I proceeded to try convincing her why she should STILL think about dating me, mostly because I've changed quite a bit (which is true, in some respects.)  It was pathetic.  I'm still a fucking wreck.

I still want to be with her, but if I must, I will have to move on and try seeing if there are any prospects out there for me.

I probably still have some things that I have to resolve within myself, but I have no idea how to do such things.

I want to throw up.

I find that I'm always nauseated nowadays.  I'm sick of the position that I am in in life.]]></content:encoded>

Start focusing your energy on things you really enjoy doing. Soccer, photography, biking, the company of your friends, etc: these were mine, I know you have yours Ian.

Time to update that profile Mr. Eight-point-five :)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Me and a friend, both of us relative newcomers to Cafe Allegro, were thinking of making a few short clips of whatever conversations that we, along with others, have at Allegro.  Pretentious?  Yeah, maybe.  But we figure that it might be a great start in terms of documenting the sort of dynamic that we see at Allegro that is probably never seen at any other coffee shop, or perhaps anywhere else in Seattle.  And hell, we're also new to filmmaking in general, so this would be a great way to get ourselves acquainted with the whole thing.

I'm thinking that this could segue into making a full blown documentary that tracks maybe three or four of us and shows exactly how our individual days pan out, which then converge to conversation at Allegro.

In any case, there are a few outstanding problems that I'm kind of trying to resolve, like getting approval from the owner, how exactly we can introduce a camera to a spontaneous conversation without disrupting the flow, exactly WHAT camera we should use in order to achieve this goal (I was thinking camera phone, but that would be way too low quality to be effective, though it MIGHT work out somehow), how we should introduce a camera into the "Allegro sphere" without disrupting the flow of the entire coffee shop, maybe also how we can get people on board this project.  I figure the other guy that I was talking to is thinking the same thing, so we'll probably meet sometime again soon and discuss these problems further.

I can always check out a camera from Kane Hall at the UW, so that's taken care of, though of course that doesn't solve the problem of the camera making people nervous and whatever else.  We'll take care of it somehow.

I'm real excited about this whole thing, though we also have to approach the whole project with the right mindset.  I think approaching it in terms of making something BIG will totally dilute the film, so it'll be small and it'll have no other intentions other than to film spontaneous conversation.

Anyway, I hope it materializes.  I really want to do this.]]></content:encoded>

<a href='http://blog.redbluemagenta.com/2007/11/20/the-genius-of-larouche/larouche-math/' rel='attachment wp-att-152' title='LaRouche Math'><img src='http://blog.redbluemagenta.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/n10708173_32113371_925.thumbnail.jpg' alt='LaRouche Math' /></a>

Side note: I shamefully talked to one of these LaRouche kids a couple of months ago, and while I was trying to say something about logic in terms of how mathematicians use logic to come up with a^2 + b^2 = c^2, a nappy haired girl popped up in front of me and eloquently hinted that, yes, rapists use logic.]]></content:encoded>

I already got an email from my German TA about my poor performance, I'm not doing so hot in my two math classes judging by my homework grades and midterm results, though I AM doing okay in my Philosophy of Religion class.

I'm sure I'll get academic probation by the end of this quarter.  And I'll be fucked.  But whatever, life goes on, and I'm sure that I can concentrate much better next quarter when I start fresh, IF there's a next quarter.

And if there isn't, I'll just read shit on my own. :>]]></content:encoded>

But then, well... first, here's the link: <a href="http://www.algebra-answer.com/algebra-helper/rudin-principles-of-mathematical-analysis-solutions.html">http://www.algebra-answer.com/algebra-helper/rudin-principles-of-mathematical-analysis-solutions.html</a>.

Basically, it's probably an automatically generated "forum thread" that substitutes in whatever book name in a template.  Then "algebra_guy" suggests that instead of "chewing on your pencil" and "asking parents for answers," the frustrated analysis student should instead use "Algebra Helper."

Except the problem is, this is analysis, not algebra.

algebra_guy is dumb. :D]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've already somewhat figured out a haphazard way of healing that might help me out considerably, which is to engage myself in conversation and throw myself into the world.

However, I've also realized that I've burned a lot of bridges in the past due to a number of factors, so I've decided to see if reconciling with those who I've lost contact with in the past will help out a bit, especially with those from Seattle University.  There's always something about rekindling contact and seeing how everyone else is doing, despite any major problems that might have happened in the past.  Admittedly, this seems like a bit of an exercise of egotism, but I feel that recreating these sorts of connections and seeing where everything lies after much change will, at the very least, set things into perspective, and will also hopefully lead to a reinvigorated friendship.

I've met someone a couple of nights ago who seems to be going along the same journey as I am.  Some of the things she said kinda put things into perspective for me, such as listening to everyone without pride in order to establish conversation and compromise in a relationship, which is definitely a major thing I still have to work on.  To be honest, I can't thank her enough for that bit of knowledge, however "small" it may be; I really needed to hear someone say it.

I've no idea where I'm really going at the moment, but I have a few options open to me after college, outside of working:

<ol>
<li>Go into the Peace Corps after college: I'll admit, I'm not much of an altruistic person when it comes to these things, though I associate much better with those who struggle than the middle and upper classes, who are generally living comfortably without much perspective.  So in that sense, I wouldn't mind being in the Peace Corps for a year or so.  And... of course, there's the peripheral benefit of getting all of my college loans paid off. :)</li>
<li>Go into graduate school for math: This is the most ideal option, since I'd be doing research in something I love studying in the first place, though my grades have been taking the turn for the suck as time goes on.  I'm also not all too confident about how I would perform in grad school considering my track record in college, but eh, academia is my sort of bag anyway.</li>
<li>Go into graduate school for something other than pure math: I wouldn't mind this either.  I was thinking either Philosophy, English, some sort of math related field, or whatever else.</li>
<li>Travel: I really want to do this, yet it's impossible, considering the stacks of student loans that I have under my name.  But this is also a very ideal option that I'd take in an ideal world; I also don't mean traveling as in sightseeing, but traveling as in, "I take only what's on my back and whatever's in my pocket, and make do as I go."</li>
</ol>

So yeah, I'm still unsure.  I'm taking everything in stride at the moment, though I feel like I've no real coherent direction aside from what little academics I'm grasping on at the moment; even though I do love academics, I really really am getting burnt out with the whole grade pursuit deal.

In any case, I've written way too much, I'll probably post more about this later.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've talked to quite a few PC alumni and am happy to see this at #1 on your list of options. Many returned volunteers actually go on to grad school, and not only does the experience give you an edge in your application process, but some grad schools will offer scholarships &amp; fellowships because of it. You even have the option of doing your masters while serving abroad. UW has 3 fields through the PC Masters International Program.

Haha...I remember taking Liana to one of the info meetings some time ago. The alumn was telling us a story about how he got shot at by robbers while in Guatemala. She walked out scared as hell and I was all gung-ho about it.

Check out this link. It breaks down the process pretty well:

More information: <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/Seminars/milliman_0708.php">http://www.math.washington.edu/Seminars/milliman_0708.php</a>

Terence Tao is an extremely important mathematician who has worked on I believe harmonic analysis and number theory, and is also the youngest recipient of the Fields Medal (which is basically the equivalent of a Nobel Prize, except it is only awarded to mathematicians under the age of 40) and a MacArthur Fellowship.

In any case, he's apparently giving a lecture each day for three days at the UW Physics/Astronomy Auditorium, starting tomorrow afternoon.  If you live in Seattle and are remotely interested in math, I encourage you to attend at least one of these lectures.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's been one week since I've last had contact with my ex.

It's still tough.  Really tough.  I don't mind not dating her anymore, but to not be able to be friends seems to drive the final nail in the grave.

I still have pictures on my computer that remind me too much of her.  I don't look at them explicitly, but when I'm scanning through my pictures, I always see them.

Anyway, dating around seems to be the best way to get my mind off of her.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are at awe when we are born.  Imagine the light flooding into our eyes as we open them for the first time; our wonder at the world as it exists rather than what is constructed through presuppositions; and the lack of memory when moments are fleeting, the future impermanent.

As time goes on, our memories are developed and we develop ourselves within a societal construct.  We presuppose meanings through prior experiences and things that are told to us through metaphors and song.  Instead of being at awe, we at once understand and thus, our curiosity wanes as our appetite for knowledge is quenched.

Our lenses in which we view the world are stained as time goes on.  We assume certain truths and base our knowledge off of that, rather than being at awe and viewing the world in wonder.  We start to then ask more complicated questions, things that go toward the core of our existence or the core of an object's existence rather than questioning the object as it exists in the world.

Perhaps when we now turn our heads toward philosophy, we have ceased to be child-like; that's why I don't like analytic philosophy.  To me, it ceases to be in awe of the world and tries to kill curiosity.  Perhaps even the quest for truth seems to be fruitless as it implies that we are trying to squelch curiosity of the mysterious force in front of us.  I'm thinking that destroying any notion of truth seeking and rather simply wonder at the beauty of the world will at least restore our humanity in a culture that seems to be devoid of wonder and humanity.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've found that I can't relate to college students in general.  I was talking to a few friends of mine who are outside of the college system (college graduated or not), and they all the same damn thing that I agree with: us college students have NO perspective.  We're sheltered.  We live in a fantasy land.

And here's another thing I can't vibe with either: most of the house parties I've went to have all been about social posturing and dominance more than anything rather than a bunch of chill people wanting to get to know everyone else (of course, in a party like that, that's almost expected, but I just have to say, it's getting tiresome meeting a bunch of people and forgetting who they are the next day.)

I'm sorry, I just can't do it anymore.  I love getting to know everyone else, just not the typical college student.  That's all.]]></content:encoded>

I've been wanting to get into film making for a while, not to mention that this will be a great way to find out more about my own culture.<br /><br />Differential geometry should be awesome as well.  I'm really thankful that I even got in the class in the first place, seeing that I failed all of the 400 level math classes that I've taken at the UW so far.  This isn't stopping me mentally from taking these classes, though; I just need to get my ass in gear and I'll be fine.<br /><br />Philosophy of Aristotle should be great, though I hear the readings are going to be REALLY REALLY REALLY fucking dry.<br /><br />Finally, Methods &amp; Imagination should be awesome; we will be reading Faulkner, Wittgenstein and other stuff with a philosophical lens, plus I hear nothing but great things about both the class and the professor.  I'm going to have a great time with this class.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For however long I can remember, I was taught how important my vote is to American society, how it is  a civic duty that I must do and that to throw away my vote is to cast away one of the tenets of our freedoms.

However, with the switch of politics in the 60's/70's toward speaking to our collective psyches with rhetoric and key phrases as opposed to simply stating their position and discussing it wholeheartedly, can we really say that our vote is important, or rather, that we are really exercising our right to vote freely based on objective information?  Of course, we could head toward the discussion on whether political information is truly objective, but that's another topic that I might touch on later.  To rephrase the last part of the question: is our voting motivated by an explicit warping of reality, if at least more so than in the past?  My method of attempting to answer these questions are based mostly on anecdotal evidence, so you can take them with a grain of salt, though I've read bits of literature and other things that have somewhat refined and, in some ways, confirmed my answers to these questions.

I was talking to an acquaintance of mine over at CafÃ© Allegro about politics, or rather, the sad state of politics in today's society.  We were discussing how similar every candidate is, how really, we are voting based on a front of what's ultimately a single cause.  In other words, it would NOT matter one bit whether we vote Republican or Democrat, since they are basically the same party going for the same goals.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we say "assume the good," we simply mean that we assume the good in any given event, person, place, etc.

Would this necessarily mean that we blind ourselves from what is bad?  Would this make us vulnerable to anything that is inherently bad?  Perhaps if we only had blind optimism to go on, then yes, it would blind us; however, we can still assume the good and still know that there can be bad.  It, of course, would also make us vulnerable to a degree, but I believe that it is ultimately worth it when we simply throw away our biases and assume the good.

In terms of social situations, if we assume the good in people, then our temperament turns toward good as well, and thus, we start to see people as they are as people, rather than attaching an automatic label or judgment upon their character.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What is human?  Observations through the lens of Tolstoy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've realized a couple of things after "reading" War and Peace (in reality, I'm only on page 250 or so) and going to Dr. Konick's lectures on "Love and War": fruitful human interaction is driven through necessity rather than by choice, and by following the spontaneous sprouting of human issues and solving them as needed will we ever accomplish "great things" in history.

Tolstoy realizes that humans are lazy and does not ever trust the conscious actions of others to do much of anything in the grander scheme of things.  There is simply an unconscious need to accomplish and resolve things that directly challenge our (physical and social) survivability; when we are only given two tough choices, that is when we make grand changes in our lives and in the world around us.

It seems prudent, then, to apply this theory to the world around us today.

First of all, I want to tackle "altruism" in charity: I've long thought that donations were simply a means to complement our narcissism in the best light possible.  The justification often stated is that even if it isn't much that we throw into the charity box, it still contributes something toward the greater good.  However, the disconnect between us actually putting the money into the box and the money that's actually used to service whoever needs the service is extremely large, though we're often fooled to BELIEVE that we're directly helping those in need.  Our well wishes do not accomplish much of anything, and throwing money into something that's so abstracted away from action will not lead to any fruitful results.

Second, I've realized that Ayn Rand's philosophy is bullshit.  Here's why: I've never read her books (okay, there goes the credibility of this entire paragraph), but I DID read the plot summary and a good overview of her philosophy presented in "Atlas Shrugged" (there, I think that makes up for it.)  Basically, Rand postulates that if everyone stopped individual contributions to society, the society will crumble on itself.  I can definitely see a situation like this happening, since I believe that humans aren't necessarily strapped to fate and can indeed make individual choices motivated in part by a free society.  However, it doesn't seem probable that the society will crumble on top of itself; perhaps that is why it is kept to fiction rather than having any sort of basis on real events.

A society's survivability depends on what it requires from each individual, and each individual living in such a society acts in according to the society's needs.  If the society espouses individualism over anything, then yes, if individuals stopped contributing to the society then it will crumble; however, since individualism is vital to the society's operation, the individuals living in such a society will naturally tend toward individualism in order to increase the survivability of the society (how ironic!)  A person's survival also relies heavily on how well the person is kept within society and not above or below it; indeed, every person is kept within the same societal and human boundaries as everyone else no matter how delusional he might be about how separate he is from society.

This has an implication on the idea of ambition and wishes.  Wishes / ambitions usually delve into the realm of human perfection; we want to transcend everyone around us and throw ourselves into a position of great influence, though we eventually crash back down and find ourselves back in the company of imperfection.  In fact, if we were to set it in the frame of the history of man, our conscious wishes and ambitions to do good will have no effect on the history of man since we would be trying to transcend man, and therefore, transcend history.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been thinking a lot about what it means for one to be human, and how religion / spirituality effects how one embraces their own humanity.  Perhaps I need to look at this at many more angles before I can provide an informed argument toward one position or another, but before doing that, I'm going to go ahead and throw my "uninformed" opinion out into the open.

The question on how to be human is a big philosophical question, something that is attacked in different ways by whatever is motivated in society at the time.  Perhaps a possible answer to the question, "what does it mean to be human," is this: to be human is to]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In some respects, I feel personally robbed of any sort of cohesive gender role these days.  There's tons of confusion floating around between taking the roles of the traditional man or the feminized man these days; we are expected to be more emotionally in touch and to be more sensitive, yet we are forced to be on a fine line at all times, since if we dip too far south toward feminization, we end up being unattractive and also end up on the bottom of the totem pole in many other respects, yet if we try to assume a more traditional male role, we would be painted as abusers and wife beaters.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I guess I'll just throw in a bunch of random crap in one blog post and throw in a header for each section.

<h2>Job</h2>

So, I've accomplished a lot in my job today.  Here's a quick list of what I did:

<ul>
<li>Installed the latest version of Arch Linux on Parallels</li>
<li>Decided it wasn't worth the time it takes to set up</li>
<li>Installed Ubuntu Linux on Parallels</li>
<li>Answered like three calls.  Stumbled on all of them.  Awesome.</li>
<li>Found out that Chicken of the Sea goes well with mayonnaise and ketchup.</li>
<li>Ate Cup of Noodles for the first time in two years</li>
</ul>

And... that's pretty much it.  Interesting, eh?

<h2>Monday night</h2>

I went with a friend of mine to a concert on the south end of Seattle over in Columbia City.  It's basically Ballard (Market Street more specifically), but super gentrified in the middle of a sketchy area, plus it has a lot more diversity.  No hipsters!

Anyway, there were three bands that played in Columbia City Theater, all three formed by current UW students.  All of them fall under the idiom of rock music, maybe borderline alternative, but rock music nonetheless.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I love talking to old dudes who are extremely well read.  In general, they have the wisdom to discriminate between one intellectual thought to another, which grants much more insight than plain intellect.  Even if they do not exactly know everything to the exact detail as to complete an argument, they have enough wisdom to fill in the blanks with anecdotes and experience.

In any case, I was talking to someone who came over with a violin over at Cafe Allegro; my friend was also with me who brought up the topic of music - more specifically, electronic music - and the repetitiveness of techno.  The old guy with the violin started talking about the "wave signature" of a particular instrument, and how techno keeps everything constant and simply varies the "wave signature" by changing the sound of the instruments.

Then... this is where we go into the deep end: he talked about n-dimensional vector spaces and how each "dimension" can be related to simply "characteristics" of a music genre.  A "characteristic" would simply be something like timbre, rhythm, tempo, etc.  Techno, for instance, has for instance, four or five dimensions, whereas Jazz could have fourteen, Hip-Hop with six, etc.  He then went into the topic on how information in general (let's say musical characteristics for brevity), with low amount of characteristics or a large amount of characteristics (or, if you will, 1, 2, or 3-dimensional vector spaces versus 100-dimensional vector spaces) become meaningless, or in other words, do not describe anything that is of any use.

something about "theory is conversation," schrodinger and boer's explanation to come to the right questioning to further clarify the concepts, everything is interdisciplinary, something about the ambulance leaving their engine on in the middle of the parking lot in order to leech wifi, music theory and its relation to writing as a transcribing/retrieval of ideas rather than mechanization of an art, mathematics and its expanding nature vs. experimental science and theoretical science's aims to shrink the information down to a minimum]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I realize that this is somewhat of a narcissistic post, but well, whatever, bear with me on this.

A close friend of mine noticed how much I've changed, another friend of mine that I haven't known for too long has noted that I'm "approachable," and I myself have noticed myself change A LOT in such a short period of time.  This has happened not too long ago, possibly within the area of around six months, maybe even within a shorter time period.

In any case, I used to be really anti-social.  I'd stumble on words quite often, I would avoid social situations as much as I could, etc.  I didn't get along with many people at my old college, which was somewhat of catalyst toward introversion, though it definitely existed before college (I suppose college is supposed to be the time where inhibitions are freed and students meet others without any fear of cliques as in high school, which, unfortunately, was not the case at SU - this has a way of causing even more introversion than in high school.)

After coming to the UW, I haven't really improved much; I still kept to myself for the most part.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This post is somewhat related to the book, but has a lot of my own experiences and opinions thrown into the mix.  In other words, it's simply another opinion post with <u>The Culture of Narcissism</u> added as a resource.

--

I'm becoming more and more disenchanted with the society I'm living in.  That is, after reading a bit of this book, I started realizing how separated each of us are and how competitive we have become with interpersonal relationships.  I personally see myself as a fairly sociable person, though because I do not compete on the same level of "excitement" and "flair" as others around me, I am eventually marginalized for not being unique and thus am thrust back outside.  In order to not be an outcast, I would have to compete against peers for others attentions and even for my peers attention, since I have to project myself as "unique" and not "drab" and "mundane" in order to win the person's subsequent allocations of time that's usually set aside for their own individual endeavors.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Perhaps this is a bad example of "proof by example," but a lot of people that I know believe that societal issues can be solved by prodding their sticks at the issues and influence it little by little until it somehow goes toward the same direction as they intended it.  However, I propose that we really cannot influence large abstract bodies (such as social constructs) with conscious action alone, but rather we can throw in a few things into a black box and see if it pops out a result.  If anything happens, we cannot attribute it to direct causality, because we do not know how the black box operates and whether if it even does anything with whatever we throw into the box.  However, if the black box does spit out something at any time, it affects everyone; that is, the amount of influence that the black box exerts on any external agent is much larger than any smattering of influence that we could possibly exert on the black box.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nausea.

I suppose that's the only word that can accurately describe everything and anything that I'm going through.

I'm still thinking things through in terms of what has transpired over the past couple of hours, days, weeks, months, etc., at least in terms of my personal situation.  Then I think about others going through the same thing; then I follow that to a social malaise that is sweeping across modern society.  Some of us recognize at least part of the overall problem and try to rebel and push against the trends without realizing that it is ultimately fruitless; again, as I probably have said before, we always act within the society, not outside of it.  Some are fine with it, though the significant problems (that could be considered social malaise) that they come across or anything that sets them to a different path are not seen as social malaise but rather individual failings or terrible circumstances.  Others are seeing part of the bigger picture (or all of it) but now realize how inconsequential any action would be to change anything.]]></content:encoded>

They have you by the balls, these charities and altruistic organizations.

Etc. etc. etc.  I've of course talked to people who believe that their donations will definitely help a poor child in Africa or wherever else, but there's such a large disconnect that the act of donation is reduced to more localized social graces and self image.  In other words, the only purpose donating money serves is that it makes us FEEL good, yet we still believe that we truly are making a difference.

On that same note, intentional altruism is equally as ineffective and]]></content:encoded>

I miss you.

But I think this is where I get off.

--

An explanation:

I want to be with you, but because of the circumstances, it is impossible.  And I simply can't wait around forever, because everything else is passing by me and I have to get on them as soon as I can.

I don't know what you're looking for, and from what you've told me, it doesn't seem like you know what you're looking for either.

I really want things to work out.  I really do.  I care about you.

But I don't know what I'm doing now.

Why am I waiting?  I can't wait.  I have to move on.

I've been heartbroken again.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[How do we derive meaning from our environment?  Does the environment create who we are?  Do we create who we are to at least a limited extent?

Perhaps the modern day environment is more of a canvas for us to paint on, though we find ourselves repainting over and over and over again since we, or others, are often either unsatisfied with the barely dried art that is not finished yet.  In a previous time, we would also similarly be unfinished, but the build up of identity and culture is apparent, none of which is thrown out in favor for another.  However, we constantly change ourselves, our appearances, our goals, etc. in order to best fit with the rapid changes that occur in our society today.  That, and we often want to change for the sake of changing.

Perhaps that is why we sometimes fall into nihilism and see that there might not be any meaning behind any of the actions that we do.

Would it be as simple as reverting back to the old analogy of the traditional man?  Probably not; the traditional man is, by what the name suggests, outmoded, and the outmoded has a very small chance of existing in any capacity in today's modern society.

How, then, do we]]></content:encoded>

Let's say that such a technology is impossible to develop, but simply the idea of remembering everything is floating around.  Would we even want to remember everything, or perhaps, would we want to eliminate forgetfulness (forgetfulness as in forgetting something unintentionally)?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here are my random thoughts on conversations in general:

I embrace every conversation.  Every single one.  There are some that might be better than others, but overall, they are gifts and not things that are occasionally thrown to the ground as though they are garbage.

Sometimes I don't discover the worth of any given conversation until much later.  I rediscover it in the depths of my thoughts and finally appreciate the art that has taken me a long time to appraise and appreciate.  Others, I rip off the wrapping as fast as possible and play with what's inside.

Often, I'm humbled to receive such insights.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Throughout the past few weeks, I've again realized more things about myself that I am in the process of changing (hopefully for the better, and not necessarily for perfection.)  I'm not really into the "self-improvement" movement, but I do realize that these things that I'm finally seeing needs to be changed in face of the things that I've learned.

For one, there is more to life than worrying about myself all the time.  I've realized that I'm extremely selfish in that regard, and that I must extend my mind beyond myself if I want to learn how to love others for who they are.  I do "love myself" for the most part, yet I still think too much about my own well being for my own good.

Second, I realize how dependent I am on others for my own well being.  In some cases, I become clingy to the point of]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A video I saw a while ago on Youtube with Ken Miller regarding "Intelligent Design" seems to have opened up my mind to what were seemingly innocuous arguments for the existence of God.  Now, it seems totally biased and ignores all knowledge that points to the contrary of their position, which seems to be a terrible, amateur mistake when it comes to philosophical discussion; that is to say, the arguments used nowadays from the "Intelligent Design" camp seems to go only for an agenda, and not for a sort of questing of truth.

But, my consistent return to the idea of mysticism keeps this from really affecting my "affinity" toward faith, whatever little there may be.  I find that science cannot possibly answer EVERYTHING, due to the mere nature of science: science, by nature, is a-posteriori, whereas mysticism is a-priori.  Thus, they pursue totally different paths that answer totally different questions.  The only conflict is when mysticism and science try to answer the same question.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll just say it right now before I go any further: group based learning in math classes is BULLSHIT.  Learning by inquiry in math is STUPID.  Most of us math students are "idiots" and do not know how to solve problems correctly without... being shown how to solve them correctly.

However, in order to give a bit more context behind my opinion, I direct you to <a href="http://www.wheresthemath.com">WheresTheMath.com</a>.  It is a website dedicated toward the goal of reinstating traditional teaching methods in primary and secondary education, but more importantly, is mostly tending toward the goal of absolutely removing the NCTM (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) curricula from schools around Washington State.

Obviously, WheresTheMath.com is concentrating on a portion of our educational system that does not affect me in a big way (that is, they are concentrating mostly on primary and secondary education, and not college education), but it DOES affect many people coming into college after me who don't have the proper mathematical training that's needed in more rigorous classes, like calculus.  Not only that, the classes are also affected as well; they are dumbed down in order to accommodate the influx of students who haven't had proper mathematical training.

I was reading some of the articles on reform math as well as videos that demonstrate the curricula and how they teach the students; they truly dumb down the material in order to eliminate "math" from "math education."  Long division isn't taught, multiplication tables aren't memorized, students are taught to add ten to itself ten times by pressing the equals sign on the calculator repeatedly (rather than multiplying ten by ten in their heads), etc.

Group based inquiry seems to be a paradigm that is encouraged often in NCTM curricula as well.  It seems to be a great idea: leave students to their devices and have them discover things by themselves in order to reach a greater understanding of the ideas.  However, it is also very idealistic: quite a few times, it's done out of laziness of the lecturer; what's worse, however, is that it falls apart due to social dynamics.  That is, the strongest link often abandons the weaker links in pace and understanding, while at the same time frustrating the strongest link since he has to "slow down" in order to have the others catch up.  The "weakest links" also often socialize amongst each other after being left behind while the stronger members take on the bulk of the work, which puts the "weakest links" even further back in understanding the material.

Even worse: the students don't even know if they're going through correct mathematical reasoning or even arrive at the right answer.

I've had quite a few classes set up this way.  I found all of them to be a huge waste of time.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been talking to various people who have lived outside of America for an extended period of time as well as various others who are wholly Americans through and through, and I've pretty much concluded one thing that may be construed as "anti-patriotic" but is really "anti-American-aesthetic": we are fucked up.  I've reached this conclusion before, though it's mostly been through reading books that directly comment on the state of our society.  To reiterate what I've said in previous posts, we live wholly within the economic dealings of an abstract quantity rather than living for the sake of living with the economics supporting this notion of emphasizing humanity over profit.  We are too satiated with our current dealings in our environment where we become too attached to materials that serve to only distance us further away from forming a coherent community with each other, not to mention that our identities are formed around what companies want us to assume rather than the roles typically borne naturally out of human interaction.  As a result, our culture is directed by the sum of the visual based advertisements displayed in front of us every day rather than being directed by cultural movements created wholly by the people living inside the society.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been going through even more crap lately with simply finding prospects in dating.  It always sucks to find someone who is seemingly into you, yet there's a bit of a misstep, then they pick someone else over your dumb ass.  It's happened almost at the same time with several people, which, to be honest, is a huge blow to the ego.

I suppose I just have to reevaluate everything, since I'm going at it the wrong way, which is to find someone to quell a "need" for a partner.  Ever since me and my ex have broken up, I've missed that sort of close company almost too much; I'm sure many can relate to that sort of situation.  In any case, I've taken the advice of a few people and simply try pursuing multiple people at the same time.  But, to be dropped over other "better" candidates by multiple people at the same time is just... shitty.

But yeah, I mean, this is simply crap that is insignificant in general: there's always SOMEONE out there and there's definitely way worse shit that someone can go through.

As I said in the previous post, I'm still very much adjusting to socializing in general, and this is one of those things that I simply have to go through in order to readjust myself to this whole thing.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm finally done with <u>Amusing Ourselves to Death</u> by Neil Postman. Some of the points he made about how education has changed through the new epistemologies of television were quite convincing.</p>
<p>The reframing of traditional, contextualized and continuous education into the fragmented, non-contextual and <span style="font-style: italic;">entertaining</span> world of television starts reframing education in children's eyes as <span style="font-style: italic;">having</span> to be entertaining. There are claims that this is a good pedagogical methodology for education and that it actually increases comprehension in many different fields of study. However, curricula based around the format of <span style="font-style: italic;">televisable entertainment</span> has to be <span style="font-style: italic;">televisable</span>; that is, the topics chosen must entertain the crowd, which most likely will be tangential to any sort of serious academic pursuit, as anything televisable must be sufficiently dumbed down and fragmented enough to appeal to the entertainment-hungry students. It is enough that this way of thinking has already manifested itself in various high schools around the country (case in point: the math curriculum in place in many high schools around the country), yet this pedagogy is seeping into college curricula as well in the form of entertaining gestures in lectures, etc.</p>
<p>Our reliance on moving images and pictures, which is concrete and non-contextual, from our upbringing around the television has hampered our ability to reason in the realm of abstract ideas, which relies on context and a continuum of lessons. This has other ramifications in education: our textbooks are now filled with pictures and diagrams in order to confirm for the reader the abstract idea in question, which means that once we encounter a book without such pictures and diagrams, we wallow in confusion until we can draw a manifest of the concept. From what I can gather, this was never a problem in education until today, where we rely too much on imagery for guidance. Also, it drives in the point that education can be approached by picking out a random topic and getting an entertaining crash course on the topic without any sort of context or motivation for the ideas; this is especially alarming, as academic topics are (obviously) much deeper than a simple televised episode, and must be approached with fervor and determination.</p>
<p>Besides, to what ends does computerized and televised educational methodologies seek to totally replace the current educational system? I would contend that it's meant to totally replace it, at least in the high school and primary school systems; teachers today who are more accepting of these pedagogical methodologies are more likely to give up their power as an instructor to computer and television programs.</p>
<p>I remember taking a class in high school that was on Cisco Networking. In a lot of ways, it's the best example that I can come up with that demonstrates the curricula changes talked about earlier: the class featured computer-based lessons and tests that were administered solely by the student, as well as weekly "meetings" where people from Microsoft come in and talk to us about business stuff, like how to present ourselves in an interview, etc. These meetings, however, were quite entertaining yet also had zero substance to them; that is, I learned nothing, the other students even admitted that they learned nothing (as well as admitting that it was <span style="font-style: italic;">entertaining</span>) when the presenters were asking for feedback on their weekly "meetings."</p>
<p>Of course, proverbial evidence is hardly proof enough for the existence of these problems, but I am sure that everyone who has taken a class within the past ten or twenty years will have at least one or two classes that exhibited the same characteristics of entertaining fluff with no substance. Such is the effect of the fun-loving culture that we live in today.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My classes are awesome.</p>  <p>CHID 205 (Method, Imagination &amp; Inquiry): This is probably the best class out of the four that I'm taking.&#160; I really love how my professor brings subtle details out into the light, as well as cultural contexts and how that plays into the difficulty in answering a question or even coming up with a question in the first place (for instance, how can we even dream of asking the question, &quot;do we have a soul,&quot; if the soul is assumed to be there in the first place?)&#160; That, and I love his sense of humor; his wit drips in almost sentence he speaks in lecture.</p>  <p>PHIL 433 (Philosophy of Aristotle): This seems to be a pretty hardcore course.&#160; There's only one ten page paper due at the end of term with absolutely no tests and quizzes.&#160; That, and Aristotle is pretty damn tough to read: there's tons of very specific definitions he uses for common words, lots of footnotes that try to clarify the text, a lot of use of a primitive form of logic, and his culmination of works that we have today are incomplete and are of things that weren't supposed to be disseminated for public use.&#160; It's still very interesting stuff, if at least in terms of historical context.</p>  <p>MATH 442 (Differential Geometry I): I love this course as well.&#160; It's fairly easy so far since it's all stuff we've covered in calculus III (that is, vector calculus in 2 and 3 dimensions), but it's supposedly going to increase in difficulty quite a bit within a week or two.&#160; Eh, I need the challenge at a time when I can finally concentrate on my work. :)</p>  <p>And finally,</p>  <p>ENGL 499 (Independent Study): We've met for the first time today in order to get the reading and film lists squared away.&#160; I'm REALLY looking forward for the discussions we'll have in the next few weeks, plus this is the first time I've done something like this in my college career; I have a feeling that this will be a very rewarding experience.</p>  <p>Yep.</p>  <p>Peace and love.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was spending too much time on Facebook and Myspace - although from what I hear, the amount of time I spent on Facebook and Myspace is not even all that much compared to many others - and I need that time for other things, like studying and actually doing shit outside of the internet.

I find that it is also a bit of a widespread problem: the fact of the matter is is that Facebook and Myspace fosters superficial relationships through profile pages that are more about vanity rather than actually revealing who the person is as a person. Â These social networking sites, therefore, makes us more into narcissists when conversing with others in front of us. Â It doesn't help that these sites are quite addicting, and thus, also wastes our time on the computer rather than doing other things that better connect us with society.

Maybe it's simply academic elitism that's driving me to do this, but I do find it to be more of a hinderance to social interaction than anything.

I personally feel that I'm better off without either website.]]></content:encoded>

I read this book (Eat that Frog by Brian Tracy) and I realized how much time I was wasting during the week.

With school, family, work,  & rotaract stuff, I am constantly feeling like I don't have enough time for other things that I want to do. Like going to the gym more regularly and reading one novel a week out of my library. Shoot, we haven't hung out in a while either.

Well....its a new year man. I am happy to see you free for all the right reasons. That book is only 113pgs so if you want to borrow it you know who to contact. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

That's why social networking sites became so popular; they fulfilled a need that every human inherently has: attention.

Does it get addictive? Sure. But again, I don't think it's the website itself that is addictive. Rather, it's the desire to be noticed that pulls you in, and it pulls you in to those specific websites because that's what they promise to deliver.

I think you're unnecessarily harsh on yourself though.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yes, but why would anyone want to beef up their image? That speaks of a problem with the individual, not with the websites in question. It sounds like you're seeking blame here, but the problem is you're seeking it in the wrong place.

Furthermore, your perspective of social networking sites is surprisingly self-centered. The fact of the matter is that there are plenty of relationships in the SNS medium that go beyond the superficial level and become something meaningful. People reconnect with old friends, meet new people, form groups, help raise funds, fund campaigns, and gather and become real friends... They are using these tools to do things they would otherwise not be able to do. They ARE connecting with society, except on a much grander scale, in ways that would be unimaginable ten, or even five years ago.

Having a Facebook account is not about changing your about me section or your status everyday, and rigorously checking out the news feed to see what people on your friends list are up to. I'm not saying this to make a jab at you. I'm saying it to point out that maybe the problem isn't with social networking sites, but rather with the (superficial) way YOU use them.

Deleting your accounts is akin to amputating the limb because you don't want to bother tending to the bruise. There are plenty of ways a smart guy like you can use social networking sites to make a meaningful impact on society. The mindset you should be in is this: where do I want to get to in life and how can these tools help me get there? Rather than: I've tried ONE way of using these tools and they did not produce the desired result, so I'm giving up because clearly the tools suck.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[well perhaps it does have to do more with the individual than the website, but i would say that examining the way it affects individuals gives a glimpse at how it affects an entire body of individuals in general.  though we're individuals with a free will, humans in general are changed inevitably toward a culture's disposition toward technologies and views on relationships when living in said culture.  it also doesn't help that we americans are raised with a narcissistic mindset, probably even more so than other countries.  i'm not totally removing the blame from any individuals who delve into these things in the most superficial manner, but we also have to acknowledge the fact that these sites feed into an already existing problem while solving other problems that you've already mentioned.

now, communicative technologies today help to stretch beyond the social border of whatever radius within a city, but i wouldn't go as far to say that they can totally replace face to face interaction; in fact, i would go as far to say that while we have the increased potential to meet more people across the globe, it inversely lowers the potential for us to create any sort of cohesive community within the local context.  we solve one problem which didn't even necessarily exist in the first place, and we also create another problem at the same time.

and it's funny you use the limb amputation analogy; marshall mcluhan uses the same sort of analogy with technology, except he states it as such (abridged, of course):

media technologies are the extensions of our limbs, with the electronic technology being an extension of our central nervous system.  however, at the same time, we self-amputate the extended limb and replace it with the technology in question (for instance, we self-amputate the foot in place of the wheel, which does not require us to walk to use it.)

check out <a href="http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/4/4-74.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/4/4-74.html</a> for more of a clarification on this concept.

anyway, social networking sites are indeed good for finding old friends and meeting new people.  however, it's not a substitute for face to face conversation, and i find that it's too bad that it's becoming the main source of conversing with others.  i don't think the supposed downsides of facebook or myspace (whether the downsides has to do with the person or the site) has anything to do with how i use it, but it has more to do with the media it facilitates conversations on.  now, i can agree with you in terms of how it's not totally facebook's fault for any sort of superficial conversations that may take place between two people, but the media in which the conversation is taking place on (that is, the internet) is what influences the development of these social networking sites, which in turn influences how conversation is shaped in today's world.]]></wp:comment_content>

What? No. That doesn't even make sense; you cannot generalize from the individual! You cannot look at individuals and draw conclusions about the population as a whole.

"in fact, i would go as far to say that while we have the increased potential to meet more people across the globe, it inversely lowers the potential for us to create any sort of cohesive community within the local context."

I strongly disagree. For one thing, social networking sites facilitate meeting *everyone*, not just people from other side of the globe. I don't think there is a trade-off there like you suggested. I am just as likely to meet locals on Facebook as I am to meet random people from Texas or Florida or Germany. In fact, the former is far more likely because of the way Facebook networks are set up.

"anyway, social networking sites are indeed good for finding old friends and meeting new people. however, it's not a substitute for face to face conversation, and i find that it's too bad that it's becoming the main source of conversing with others."

Again, just because it is becoming a main source of conversing with others for YOU, or for person X, doesn't mean it is like that for everyone else. Most of my friends on Facebook for example use it just to augment their real-world interactions.

I mean the thing that bothers me is that society went through this same debate around the time cell phone use wwas becoming wide-spread. They said cell phones suck because they destroy face-to-face conversation etc. etc. turns out that's not the case at all.

Besides, I'm not sure why a "cohesive community in the local context" somehow trumps other forms of communities. Because that's the theme of your post; you're speaking as if that is the superior form of community and all others are somehow inferior and thus we must react negatively towards all tools that encourage them, allegedly at the expense of the local one.]]></wp:comment_content>

psychology does exactly that, though this is of course generalizing from a sociological point of view; however, the proposition you put forth somewhat stems from the individualistic mindset that america espouses, which at least puts on the illusion that everyone is unique in every way (which is partially true).  however, in terms of societal influences, no one can escape from this influence, and thus, the societal influence will influece everyone uniformly across the board.  this is not to say that it will remove the whole idea of individuality, it just means that everyone will tend to follow what the new societal norm has become.

"I strongly disagree. For one thing, social networking sites facilitate meeting *everyone*, not just people from other side of the globe. I don't think there is a trade-off there like you suggested. I am just as likely to meet locals on Facebook as I am to meet random people from Texas or Florida or Germany. In fact, the former is far more likely because of the way Facebook networks are set up."

right, but what sort of relevancy does the person from far away have with you here in america (in terms of what they do, and not necessarily the relevance of the person themselves)?  the only relevance lies in the little quips in their profile, which is a serious detachment from any real context in the world.

"Again, just because it is becoming a main source of conversing with others for YOU, or for person X, doesn't mean it is like that for everyone else. Most of my friends on Facebook for example use it just to augment their real-world interactions."

i personally mainly converse with people in person, and then use facebook whenever communication is not face to face or over the cell phone.  the reason why i make the assertion that facebook is becoming the main mode of communication is because it is permeating the real world in more ways than one, and it is transforming the landscape of conversations in terms of what photos to put up from a party, or even "friending" someone after meeting them in real life.

"I mean the thing that bothers me is that society went through this same debate around the time cell phone use wwas becoming wide-spread. They said cell phones suck because they destroy face-to-face conversation etc. etc. turns out that's not the case at all.

Because that's the theme of your post; you're speaking as if that is the superior form of community and all others are somehow inferior and thus we must react negatively towards all tools that encourage them, allegedly at the expense of the local one."

there is some truth to that; though face to face conversation is essentially irreplacable at its core, the cell phone has made conversation into something that has to be more immediate, or, to put it another way, the immediacy of getting a hold of someone through the cell phone has permeated the mindset of immediacy to all facets of american life.

i personally think that not all communities are created equally (at least if we're talking about general classes of communities separated by communicative technologies); the mode of discourse is significantly different between any two mediums of communication, and when a communicative technology is permeated, it inevitably creates a new mode of discussion.  so yes, when new technologies are released, the prior mode of discussion is sacrificed for the benefit of the other.  the new mode of discourse may or may not be a positive gain between the prior and the present modes of discourse, but in this case, it may be a negative loss from what we've had before (though to be honest, it's better than what we've had in the past few decades with one way communication with the TV.)

(i'll write more later; i do suggest you read the URL i posted in a previous comment, and also look into neil postman and marshall mcluhan.  those two guys aren't academic hacks, but are huge, influential media theorists who have talked about this same issue, and have lots of insightful things to say about communicative media in general.)]]></wp:comment_content>

Yeah, but credible psychological studies use large, random, equally-distributed samples rather than individuals themselves. If they want to say something about Americans, they take, say, 20 random people from each state, race, income-level, etc etc. and then use the results to generalize.

That's not what you're doing here. You're looking at yourself, your own usage of social networking sites, and you're using what you find to draw conclusions about the population. That's not a valid scientific study, and your results are way off simply because you, or people like you in general (smart, analytical, hip), do not represent everyone else.

"right, but what sort of relevancy does the person from far away have with you here in america"

Depends how you define relevancy. To be frank, I don't know what you mean by it. Personally, I appreciate the fact that the information is available. I sometimes go on random people's Facebook profiles and check out their favorite music or books, and then go on Amazon or whatever to check out those bands or authors. Sometimes I browse through their notes to see if they have written anything of value to me (some good ideas maybe).

They may be removed from me in context, but they are still valid subjects to study for exchange of information and ideas.

Am I interested in what they are doing at the time? No. That's why I don't look at their status, or their relationship status or their pictures. But there are things I do find relevant about them. That is why Facebook allows you to, for example, run searches based on your favorite bands, i.e. so that you can find other people with similar taste.

Like I said, I think you have a very, very limited view of how social networking sites are generally used.

"so yes, when new technologies are released, the prior mode of discussion is sacrificed for the benefit of the other."

Not always, and not really. People still talk on the phone even though email has emerged as a new medium of communication.

"face to face conversation is essentially irreplacable at its core"

So far you have failed to demonstrate why.]]></wp:comment_content>

eh, touche.  however, no one is free from the influences of culture, and since facebook/myspace has become a part of mainstream culture, it has, inevitably, spread (to a degree) to everyone in the culture.  any sort of issue that one might face is not necessarily unique but simply a "perturbation" of a general issue that exists, interpreted through a series of other experiences that also have the same quality of "perturbation" from a general set of stimuli.

Sometimes I browse through their notes to see if they have written anything of value to me (some good ideas maybe).

They may be removed from me in context, but they are still valid subjects to study for exchange of information and ideas.

Am I interested in what they are doing at the time? No. That's why I don't look at their status, or their relationship status or their pictures. But there are things I do find relevant about them. That is why Facebook allows you to, for example, run searches based on your favorite bands, i.e. so that you can find other people with similar taste.

Like I said, I think you have a very, very limited view of how social networking sites are generally used."

are you sure that the way you use these sites is, indeed, the general perception on how it is to be used?  i'm inclined to think that any light undertaking with these social networking sites is simply an exception to the rule, as most people in our generation are already wired to the internet and are thus more prone to using it to a certain excess, perhaps beyond your own usage of the sites.

i'm still of the opinion that human interaction ought to be continuous, like how it was before, and not disconnected from context and separated into small pieces like on these websites.  in other words, there ought to be a narrative in one's relation to another and not this sort of laundry list of favorites and characteristics.

"Not always, and not really. People still talk on the phone even though email has emerged as a new medium of communication."

yes, but also, email exists in a different class of communication - namely, text - than the phone, which occupies the auditory space.  a more prudent comparison would be email versus written letters.

"So far you have failed to demonstrate why."

i loathe the thought of even imagining a society where this did not exist, but i'd imagine that we'd have to further abstract the senses of hearing, sight and touch as well as destroy the familial structure in order to reach the final conclusion of having a society without face-to-face interaction.  but to be honest, even if we did that, we would still be drawn toward face-to-face interaction in whatever way possible.  i know, it isn't even all that convincing of an argument, but maybe another angle of attack will be more convincing:

we are a social species.  the nuances of face-to-face interactions are lost in any other medium of interaction thus far, and cannot be adequately represented with what we have (emoticons, etc.)

...

as i was writing it, i realize what you're driving at, and can be a bit problematic to prove.  ethically speaking, i think we ought to NOT eliminate it by whatever means necessary for sociological and psychological reasons.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The film class I'm taking has been quite the ride so far; it's definitely an intellectually stimulating activity being in a seminar with a round table discussion on various aspects of film and Filipino-American culture.<br /><br />And, on top of that, we're finally going to be shooting film tomorrow!&nbsp; We've got my friend's Canon GL-1 on top of the Canon GL-2 that I'll be picking up from Kane Hall tomorrow afternoon, so we'll be going around shooting random footage of conversations, our OWN discussions on trying to figure out how to shoot a film, scenery, etc.<br /><br />It's all very random, but eh, I figure we'll figure something out once we cobble the footage together.<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I think I have a bit of a better grasp at the sort of culture issues that we minorities face all of the time.&nbsp; I've just finished <u>Disoriented</u> and <u>The Debut</u> just a minute ago, and a lot of it strongly resonates with me, especially the little bits and pieces of family life that I can definitely relate to.&nbsp; On the other hand, there's also a lot that I can't relate to at all, since the environment that I've grown up in was totally opposite to what went on in the movies; I lived in a mostly white neighborhood with pretty much no Filipinos who were even close to the Filipinos in <u>The Debut</u>.&nbsp; That, and my extended family, at least on my mom's side, are already Americanized to such a high degree that I haven't really experienced family reunions that were "Filipino" through and through.<br /><br />Our mother culture slips away as more and more generations are born within a "foreign" country.&nbsp; With this in mind, it's important to retain a sense of our culture and to appreciate the struggles that our parents have been through in order to put us here in America.<br /><br />However, how can we retain our culture without dividing our own community?&nbsp; There's a lot of inner community tension in both movies, which, unfortunately, accurately reflects the inner community tension experienced in today's Filipino-American community.&nbsp; There's the new immigrants, the first generation Filipinos and the second / third / fourth / etc. generation Filipinos.&nbsp; It's divided even further depending on how close in touch one might be with either the Filipino culture or the, well, stereotypical Filipino-American culture where being thugged out is the way to fit in.<br /><br />I'm personally slipping away from all of this and am perhaps just one more Filipino-American who recedes the culture to the background.&nbsp; But I know this is probably the worst way to deal with this sort of tension and that I should, at the least, learn as much as I can about my own mother culture before I scurry away from all of the cultural conflicts within the community.<br /><br />I don't know though.&nbsp; The movies, while at times over the top and unrealistic (at least in relation to my own experience here in Seattle), brought these cultural issues further toward the foreground, and maybe that's enough for me to start doing something about it, starting with my own education of my own culture, then maybe we'll see from there whether I should keep running away from the community or not.<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found this quote from Twitter.com very quaint:</p>  <blockquote>Twitter puts you in control and becomes a modern antidote to information overload.</blockquote>  <p>Twitter, however, from at least its description on the website, is simply yet another application that adds to the disarray of information that is mostly irrelevant. What problem does this solve? Or rather, is this EVEN a solution? Is knowing about what a friend is doing at an exact moment truly relevant? Would knowing a piece of disconnected information do anything for us? Perhaps Twitter, along with say Facebook and Myspace, help to disseminate irrelevancy to even higher levels than what TV could do, by democratizing the process and at least give the illusion that all of the information coming into the screen is truly relevant, when in fact it was not needed in the first place.</p>  <p>Meh. More on this subject later, I've a lot more stuff to read. ;p</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine was talking to me about a lecture that a visiting professor gave at the UW (or somewhere close by) a while ago, and that he proclaimed that &quot;language is fiction.&quot;</p>  <p>This blew my mind.&#160; Language, fiction?!&#160; Made up?&#160; But then, when we think of metaphors and the ways we try to cognate words to attach to meanings, as well as the way we fool around with language in order to mean something else with the same set of words, or perhaps attaching new meanings to words, etc., we see that this might indeed be an illuminating statement.&#160; I personally don't know much about the motivators behind the phrase nor do I know enough about literature nor philosophy to really comment on it, but it seems to be at least a great starting point for my own inquiry into the topic.</p>  <p>My friend also said that the professor gave a really nice and brief example: if this statement is true, then what is the difference between a laundry list and a poem?&#160; Answer: one doesn't pretend to be fiction.</p>  <p>Awesome.&#160; Anyway, I need to talk to this guy again and maybe get a good set of reading materials that might help to clarify the statement a bit more.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Or perhaps to generalize the question, what makes a piece of work more ethnically inclined in America than, say, a piece of work by a white American?&#160; And what minimal elements of the culture must be explicitly dealt with in the work in order for it to be &quot;Filipino-American?&quot;</p>  <p>These questions underline what Roger, Aaron and I are trying to address in our short films, though the questions and answers aren't necessarily obvious from a first or second viewing of any of our potential films nor any other Filipino-American film that I've watched to date.</p>  <p>I figure that a good portion of the cultural issues that are present in the Filipino-American communities around the United States have to do with the loss of Filipino culture to the mainstream American culture, mostly through the loss of the appreciation of &quot;old&quot; Filipino culture from one generation to the next.&#160; I was talking to someone earlier tonight about this issue, and he made a good point that I've known myself for a while, though it's been kept somewhere in the back of my head for a long time: Filipinos tend to be more invisible and less proud of their own culture, because Filipinos are so enamored by American culture (perhaps due to the &quot;colonization&quot; of the Philippines by America in the early 20th century) and is thus more willing to throw away the culture in favor for American products and sensibilities.&#160; Fortunately, the eventual loss of culture is recognized as a problem, yet the ensuing reaction to this problem has also created another problem: divisions within the community.&#160; Can one call themselves Filipino if they are entrenched in American culture?&#160; Perhaps we Filipino-Americans have created a false dichotomy between us and the rest of America, and that we should simply throw away these questions and simply appreciate what we have.&#160; But, of course when we do that, we cease to be critical of what's being pulled out of our culture, and we in turn become complacent and start to forget our history, which causes Filipino culture to become even more invisible and irrelevant.</p>  <p>To try to answer the first question, I'm quite convinced that for a film to be &quot;Filipino-American,&quot; it must deal with a certain set of issues that are somewhat visible to the public.&#160; I'll be honest, most if not all Filipino-American culture is invisible to the general public, so it must be illuminated explicitly; however, while typing this, it just occurred to me that for an African-American film to be African-American, it had better include bits and pieces of African-American culture in the film, else it will be just a typical garden variety film.&#160; But what about racial sensibilities that have the potential to come out when directing a film?&#160; Perhaps our sensibilities will come out and display themselves on film through any sort of subconscious decisions in editing and filming; but then again, if say we're talking about Filipino-American directors, who have of course experienced around the same sort of troubles with their identity as the next Filipino-American, we could also expect some sort of identity conflict and struggle to even make visible any sort of sensibilities that the director might have.&#160; So I figure that since Filipino-American culture is considerably more invisible than African-American culture, not to mention the existence of a widespread identity crisis that would befuddle the sensibilities of the director in question, the filmmaker must explicitly deal with a few stereotypes or issues rather than assume a base knowledge that the viewer might have about the issues or culture.</p>  <p>What I've written up above seems to have opened up a few cans of worms (for me at least) that I'll need time to clarify: one problem to tackle would be the &quot;identity crisis&quot; and how it relates to clarifying one's discourse on Filipino-American issues (clarifying in the sense that we ought to clarify our identity before we talk about issues like &quot;invisibility&quot; and the like.)&#160; These new problems will be dealt with later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you guys heard of this?<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Chanology<br /><br />They've
done one protest so far across the world which is a hell of an
achievement, and they are planning another protest on March 15th, which
coincides with L. Ron Hubbard's birthday, though I am quite critical of
the execution and the intentions behind the protests.<br />
<br />
The videos I have seen so far of the protests have shown that most of
the participants indulge in a sort of internet meme dance off, which,
while fine in isolation among others who know of the internet memes in
question, has quite an effect of driving away any sort of casual
participation in the protests.&nbsp; If the entire movement is based around
a certain community who participate in a particular website (4chan, for
those who don't know), the entire movement becomes more exclusive, even
if the basis of the protest is grounded in a problem that is known by
many outside of the internet community.<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This blog post was spurned by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/-fWJH5KG9jc">this interview of biographer Andrew Morton</a>.

(side note: my views on Scientology will not be expressed in this blog post)

In any case, he made a very good point in the last minute or two of the video: we live in an age that has retrogressed toward a period that was previous to the Age of Enlightenment, where we follow ideologies blindly rather than conduct inquiries into our collectively accepted beliefs in order to suss out any inconsistencies that exist in the belief in question.  This goes for both religious ideologies and secular ideologies that exist today.

Today, we find ourselves fighting religious precepts without stopping and analyzing the stance that we assume, whether it be from a theistic or atheistic viewpoint.  In fact, I would say that the "New Atheism" that exists today is equally as inconsistent as any religious doctrines that atheists charge for being inconsistent.  We also find that most of our beliefs of the world are rooted in rhetoric rather than in well articulated and consistent arguments.  The questions we ought to ask ourselves are, "why do I believe this?  How did I come to accepting this belief?"  Once we conduct an inquiry into our own beliefs through these two questions, we will find that it is often rooted in our upbringing or a collective acceptance of the belief in question, rather than in any well conducted inquiry that would prove our beliefs to be correct.

In any case, I find it extremely important for us to inquire into our beliefs and be as self-critical as possible; we should not simply accept beliefs that float around in our society with conviction, but rather, we should accept facts/beliefs after it has been scrutinized, picked apart, and shown to be consistent with the world.<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I seem to have fell into an academic trap within the past year.</p>  <p>When I read Marshall McLuhan's <u>Understanding Media</u> - which I ought to read again - and Neil Postman's <u>Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business</u>, I've placed myself into a prescriptive role over media which has permeated throughout our society.&#160; I stood by books and other more traditional media as the only true arbiters of art and general knowledge, and have, in general, dismissed television, video games, and to a degree, the internet, as valid means of communicating information.&#160; At least McLuhan gives a bit of insight into this topic: he states that once we transform or change the medium, we change the message.&#160; Or to perhaps use his aphorism, &quot;the medium is the message.&quot;&#160; It is, then, easy to fall into a conundrum of dismissing any forms of media that falls outside communicative media outside of the Enlightenment: it was, of course, the age of huge intellectual growth, where man finally embraced reason over theism.</p>  <p>However, we could take the more descriptive route when talking about McLuhan's ideas and contend that while printed media has become a bit less popular than other media in this day and age, it does not necessarily mean that our society is dwindling down to an age of unreason.&#160; We can now assert that, yes, there is some validity in the &quot;art&quot; of the new media, and yes, we can finally remove those damned quotation marks around &quot;art&quot; when talking about television programs and video games.&#160; It is easy to construct a fairly strong argument as to why society is &quot;dwindling&quot; based on hindsight.&#160; It is, however, now clear to me that these arguments are the equivalent of snobbery, a sort of intellectual hide out where one may hold onto ideals of days gone by without realizing that the ideal that they have held onto has gone through the same criticism and contempt as the very thing that they are criticizing.&#160; To use Henry Jenkins' terminology, the art of the people, &quot;popular art,&quot; has always been snubbed in favor for the &quot;great arts,&quot; with imitators reminiscing of such &quot;great arts&quot; creating mediocre works of art, or, in other words, &quot;middle brow art.&quot;&#160; Popular art almost always becomes &quot;great art&quot; after the &quot;popular art&quot; is disassociated with contemporary society.</p>  <p>So, in any case, hopefully this realization will lend a bit more leeway and insight into any sort of questioning I have of a particular piece of art, whether it be video games, movies, or televised programs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a few maxims that I follow when dealing with the issue of gaining knowledge. Â Should we totally trust our intuitions when approaching phenomena? Â Should we totally doubt our intuitions? Â What about methods, should we adopt empiricism wherever we go? Â In any case, here's what I personally adopt as a set of maxims when dealing with these problems:<div><br /></div><div><ul><li>Intuition is both to be trusted and to not be trusted. Â A corollary to this is that we ought to not overgeneralize, but also we also ought to not totally distrust our cognitive capacity to tie phenomena together in order to postulate a working concept about the phenomena observed.</li><li>Argue from causes, not from principles. (Bacon)</li><li>Know that any working theory is just that: a working theory. Â It may break down at any given time. (Peirce)</li><li>There is no "absolute truth."</li><li>What truth we obtain from science is, again, a working theory, but it is the best method we have so far in investigating truth.</li><li>Intuitions shape the way the world organizes itself in front of us. Â This is to not be trusted when investigating TRUTH, but is essential since we cannot "turn off" our intuitions.</li><li>Arguments from emotion are especially misleading, as it carries our intuitions too far and eschews empirical evidence as much as possible in favor for what "feels right," and not for what "is right."</li></ul></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I guess I finally can rest and stop here with my job hunting... I've recently snagged a temporary job working as an audio/visual maintenance person for a vascular disease conference (which is transitioning over to podcast compiling person very soon.) Â I've got an interview coming up for Fred Meyers as well with a medical genetics lab in the UW Medical Center. Â I'm hoping that the lab takes me on, since I figure it'd be better to crunch numbers out for a lab than to stand around for five hours.

In any case, during the Vasculata 2008 conference, a few lectures caught my eye, namely the lectures concentrating on systems biology. Â I can't understand biology jargon worth a damn, but the systems biology lectures were pretty accessible and were actually pretty interesting in terms of the ways that math can be applied to large networks of genes (and other biology stuff as well.)

I can't say I know all of the foundational stuff that might be required to start in this field, but it's pretty compelling stuff that might just get me sucked into biology.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll get to the whole Magpie thing in a minute, but first, I wanted to enumerate my thoughts on animal rights that have been in the back burner for quite a while.

I have been on the fence about animal rights for quite a while now, and to be honest, I hadn't given much thought to the whole thing until it was brought up in a conversation between me and Sara a few months back. Â Being quite unfamiliar with the arguments in favor for animal rights as well as having no real stake in the subject (I haven't had any pets, and my family raised me on meat all through my life), I've been pretty interested in learning about what arguments testify for animal rights, while at the same time, staying as skeptical as possible. Â Now, I wanted to stay skeptical because, to me, I do not know anything at all about animal rights, nor do I know much about the counter-arguments from meat advocates. Â That, and I feel that, granted, if say we had totally sussed out the ethics involved in animal rights, then what good would it do when there are economies established totally around meat production? What about biology, where research is dependent on genetically modified mice? Â I do like the ultimate goal of animal rights advocates, which I believe is to end all animal cruelty, exploitation, and killing. Â I just, at this point in time, cannot attach myself totally to the cause, because I think there's more work to be done to really justify the claims of both animal rights advocates and its detractors. Â But good on ya, if you support animal rights.

And that's about where I am at right now in trying to figure out everything in my head about the animal rights issue. Â I suppose this is where I start introducing the whole Magpie article.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So yeah, I've posted my schedule back in May, and I've finally got all of my books.&nbsp; I started reading a few of my books (namely, linear programming and philosophy of language), both being pretty interesting.&nbsp; We'll see how the classes go, which start in... nine hours?<br /><br />Anyway, I'm also trying to look for a place for under $500 that's somewhat close to the UW, or at least next to a bus line that goes to the UW.&nbsp; There's a potential room that's open in the U-District that's exactly $500 per month which I'm going to be checking out this week.&nbsp; Hm, hopefully this whole job/school/put-all-of-my-paychecks-into-rent-and-not-into-food thing can be juggled successfully for someone who hasn't had to do such a thing ever in his life. :)<br /><br />And, note to self: never, ever talk about plans of changing jobs with coworkers.&nbsp; This may backfire pretty badly. :D<br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm fucking up again this quarter.

IÂ haven't gone to any of my classes (except for my Tagalog class) for several weeks now, and I am scared about failing, about going back into class after not showing up for several weeks, about finding out how shitty my grades are after not receiving any of my midterms / quizzes back, etc. Â In other words, I have absolutely no motivation whatsoever to sit in a lecture, take notes, take quizzes and tests, etc.

I feel that I've pissed away my chances of getting into graduate school, thanks to me failing a handful of classes last year, and getting just a passing grade (a 1.7 or a little above that) in a few others.

I'm all down and out about it, because I still have a lot of interest in math, but I feel that if I cannot even get a relevant job that would thrust me into a position where I can study it more, then I should just give up on the whole idea of academia in general.

ARGH. Â And I'm stuck with $30,000 worth of debt!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[About three months ago, I posted <a href="http://robotdoves.blogspot.com/2008/08/welcome-back-my-good-friend.html">a comment</a> on <a href="http://robotdoves.blogspot.com">a feminist blog</a>, which, I'll concede, is a bit too blunt and perhaps uninformed comment about feminism.  Then just recently, they posted <a href="http://robotdoves.blogspot.com/2008/12/anit-intellectual-feminist-movement.html">a response to my comment</a> on their blog.  First, here is what I said:
<blockquote>i think, in my opinion, why people cannot take most feminist views with any seriousness is because (to me) it's EXTREMELY anti-intellectual. to put it even more bluntly, a lot of what's being said on behalf of feminism sounds like a lot of whining, not well thought out argumentation.  i personally can't take any position seriously when logic is replaced with pure passion and citations from "authority."</blockquote>
I will break down their response into smaller chunks and response to each chunk with as much "laughable argumentation" as possible (I guess.)

First,
<blockquote>Why separate your mind and heart? Why not have an emotional concern about what intellectual thought your mind takes in?

The problem with the theory "emotions inhibits logic" is that it just doesn't make sense. There is nothing wrong with embracing your emotions, living life with pure passion. Try it sometime, it might bring some good and less awkwardness that may have in the past require you to lean on <a href="http://www.neilstrauss.com/">Neil Strauss </a>to teach you social dynamics between men and women (and this is said cause I know a little something something about who wrote the comment..hehe) Neil Strauss, that is, who believed self fulfillment is achieved when you have complete control over your interactions with
women. Neil Strauss. .. I should do a post on him since apparently his tv show is still played.</blockquote>
I don't agree with the duality of emotions and logic myself, though I am unsure as to whether there is research actually showing that they might be inseparable.  Marvin Minsky suggests in <em>The Emotion Machine </em>that emotions are simply different ways of thinking, with "reason" being simply an emotion.  However (and yes, this is a dogmatic point of view), I believe that education can help us train ourselves in order to just simply get to the point and argue with novel premises, rather than devolve into a sort of screaming match.  There's NOTHING wrong with living life with passion, but what the hell does that have to do with, say, providing good argumentation?  Is being clear with our arguments analogous to living a cold, heartless life?  What the fuck?

Also, the ad hominems will be dismissed, but I do want to clarify something about Mr. Neil Strauss: he is a fucking idiot.  Why?  Because his commentary on the interactions of men and women is backed up by nothing, and well, on the practical side of things, he's steadily losing clout over many of his followers, for most people are starting to realize how much bullshit he really stuffed in the minds of people.  I point the reader to <a href="http://blog.redbluemagenta.com/2007/08/25/an-open-response-to-âthe-community-is-a-mean-not-an-endâ/">a prior blog post</a> in which I partly explain why the "Community" is a bit messed up.

Second,
<blockquote>this comment is almost laughable. Anti-intellectual? Pure passion?...what I think he was really trying to say was that feminists were too emotional about how they were victimized which inhibits all their ability to think on any rational or logic level. basically a lot of women got pissed and created a movement out of it. I never thought I'd ever be quoting Dinesh D'Souza, but as he would say, I think the train has left that station. Most that currently criticize the feminist movement don't use that sort of naive and uneducated criticisms anymore. Cause, like I said, it's straight up laughable.</blockquote>
I'll concede the point.

Third,
<blockquote>Most universities, that is, a hub for people to engage in intellectual thought, HAVE a women studies department. SO is it really "rational" and "logical" to claim that a university would spend money on an academic department that was thought to be "anti-intellectual?" and even looking at the bigger picture of feminism, I don't really see how breaking down the systemic ways that women have been historically oppressed in this country is anti-intellectual. This requires connecting complex theories with empricial data to make sense of the fucked up social fabrication of this culture. Oops, I said "fucked up," is that an illustration of my emotions inhibiting my ability to articulate myself, forcing me to resort to elementary curse words.</blockquote>
Unfortunately, the entire post breaks down here.  The fact that universities are (in a vacuum) a place of intellectual development, and that there are women's studies departments in universities, ends up being a contingent claim.  As an example, take the mathematics department.  In a vacuum, math would have all of the funding it would want, for it is vital in many other disciplines, plus pure math research is pretty important in its own right.  However, in reality, math departments often struggle to get funding, and the only way they are kept afloat is because other disciplines require their students to take the introductory calculus sequence from the math department.  If all of these departments created their own math classes for their own students, the math department would fall through the ground.  So really, funding for each program is often made on a more pragmatic level than we would like to assume...

Also, the conclusions that I've seen so far have been, for the most part, quite sweeping.  And I am pretty unhappy with the results that have come about as well: I am not saying this as a man, but as a person who would love to believe that people can be distinguished only by their merit (in academia), and not by their race, gender, etc.  There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that I can bring up which showed how artificial the checks and balances can be in order to make things "equal" for all people, like for instance, the attempt to make the IT workforce about 50/50 men and women.  Okay, so we'll reject a few men here and there for the sake of having women in the workforce, despite the possibility that the said men have IT as their passion, and said women end up not being all that passionate about IT.

Again, to reiterate my point, I am totally opposed to the current mainline methods of feminism, NOT to SOME of its conclusions.  There is another branch which I'd love to read more from, which is Analytic Feminism.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I've recently started my new job over at a research lab down in UW SLU, and it's going great so far. Â For now, I've been doing inventory of all of the computers that we own in the lab (it's about 15 or so, not too bad), doing disk backups, a little manual labor, some basic technical support, and a little bit of research into a few pieces of software. Â But I guess soon I'll be getting a Linux desktop for me to fool around with, as well as making sure that a Linux server that handles all of the experimental data is running smoothly.

Because of this (and because I love fucking around with Linux, and because it's been a bit too long since I've had a running system on my machine), I've decided to download and install several different distributions of Linux and run them all in VMWare. I have Fedora 10 and Gentoo 2008.0 (both x86) running on my Macbook under VMWare Fusion 2.0.1, as well as openSUSE 11.1 (x86_64) on my main desktop under VMWare Fusion 2.0.1. Â I have the 64-bit versions of Fedora 10, Ubuntu 8.10, CentOS 5.2, and Arch Linux 2008.06 downloading right now, and I plan on installing all of them on my desktop within the next couple of days. I might put up short reviews of each of them, as well as my experiences on getting them to work with VMWare Fusion 2.0.1 (so far, Fedora 10 works great WITHOUT vmware-tools, and I've tried to install vmware-tools briefly last night to no result; I'll have to do a little bit more research into how to solve that problem.) Â I haven't yet installed all of the fancy GUI crap on my Gentoo install yet, but that will be coming soon.

Probably after I get these VM's up and running (though my hindsight is telling me that I should've done x86 installations on my desktop, so I can easily throw them onto my Macbook!), I'll see how they fare in general and then I'll see if I can use my Macbook at work with these VM's open. Â We'll see.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, after reading a friend's blog, I got to thinking about what sort of stuff I should probably set for myself in the short term, which hopefully will turn into long term habits.

One of these things is appropriately budgeting my money. Â Okay, so I'm still in college, and I don't have to pay my loans (yet), so the highest priority expenditures have yet to incorporate anything more than simply rent, utilities, and groceries. Â Fair enough. Â I don't spend all too much on groceries, maybe ten dollars per week at the most, and my rent is real cheap as well (though it is doubling in a little over a week from now since I'm moving soon with Sara), so my income minus these highest priority expenditures equals a fairly highÂ disposableÂ income. Â However, my current "luxurious expenditures" are pretty damn high. Â For instance, I buy coffee at least twice a day (only a double shot espresso, which is about $2.00 per cup), but I also buy chips (~$1.25), an energy drink (~$2.50), and a cookie (~$1.50). Â Yeah, I buy chips and cookies every day because I'm way too lazy to prepare my own food ahead of time.

So that equals about $10 per day. Â I spend almost nothing during the weekend, so in the seven days in a week, that's already $50 per week. Â That, and I buy a pack of cigarettes once every three days, so that's about an extra $10-$15 per week. Â $60-$65 total. Â Shit.

So here is my plan: if I absolutely need to keep myself awake, I'll make coffee in my house and put it into my Thermos before I head out. Â While I'm doing that, I should prepare breakfast and pack whatever is left over for the entire day. Â I should buy groceries instead of eating crap from deli's and coffee shops.

I'll need to get myself to stop smoking as well, though I REALLY REALLY need a compelling reason in order to get myself to stop. Â So far, I haven't stumbled upon such a compelling reason, so that's something I'd have to work on as well.

More time needs to be allocated to sitting down and reading my assigned readings, as well. Â I'm finding out more and more that the current dogma of philosophy is real hard to swallow, but well, fuck, I need to actually get decent grades for the final two quarters of my college career.

Anyway, that's about it. :O]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, for next quarter, I have to take Intro to Logic, a 400 level course, a philosophy elective, and Tagalog.Â  Okay, cool, so I saw that there was an Axiomatic Set Theory course offered next quarter, a Philosophy of Kant course, and I just found out that there is a Philosophy of Math course as well.Â  Cool, those ALL sound super interesting, except that the first two courses are at the same exact time on the same exact days, while taking Phil. of Math would conflict with both Logic and Tagalog (yes, out of all of the three or four sections of Logic, NONE of them work with Phil. of Math and Tagalog).

This happened this quarter as well, though I forgot exactly which courses I was thinking of taking.Â  I ended up in Epistemology and Intro. to Metaphysics eventually, and I can't say I enjoy either of them as much as I thought I would. :(

At least the math department knew that people would want to take, say, Fundamentals of Analysis, Algebra, Topology, maybe some sort of special topics course, etc. all in the same quarter, so they actually schedule them at different times on different days from each other.Â  Philosophy, on the other hand, is a fucking mess.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To put it bluntly, there is way too much unwarranted use of science, mathematics, etc. in philosophy in order to establish or attack philosophical positions. Â "Determinism vs. indeterminism" is one such problem child debate: this debate is almost analogous to a religious argument, with a good dose of unwarranted use of math. Â Another example is my philosophy professor saying that there are less even numbers than there are natural numbers: he stated that it is intuitively clear that there are less even numbers than natural numbers, therefore, it ought to be clear that if we stretch it to the entire infinite sets of natural numbers and even numbers, the same relation of cardinality holds. Â AND NO, IT DOESN'T! Â Argh! Â I'm not even going to try to entertain the idea on how to justify that the two sets are exactly the same size, because it is almost all too clear to most, if not, all practicing mathematicians, and at the very least, it's clear to almost all math students.

I was reading a thread on <a href="http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/47/science-math-philosophy/indeterminism-newtonian-mechanics-391207/">indeterminism and mathematics</a>, and while I am pretty dumb at physics, the discourse on the forum pretty much shows me that Norton's proof of indeterminism <em>fails</em>Â for the mere fact that he is, (1) doing the math wrong, (2) getting high school physical intuition totally wrong.

Determinism is highly problematic as well: it's <em>extremely</em>Â convenient, philosophically, to whittle the world down to simple causal chains between one state of the world and the next state of the world. Â It's <em>foolish</em>Â to say such a thing in face of evidence. Â And it's even more <em>foolish</em>Â to claim that we are missing a variable or two in order to collapse a probabilistic system to a deterministic system!

Meh. Â Maybe I'll get a more level headed post in here sometime in the near future. :)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Twenty credits. Â Here they are:

PHIL 472: Axiomatic Set Theory
PHIL 460: Philosophy of Science
PHIL 120: Intro. to Logic
AAS 308: Basic Tagalog

Â I can't wait for 472 myself; I've been clamoring for math for a while, and though this isn't in the math department, it will have to do for now.

This is going to be my final quarter in college as well.

As much as I want to start working, I also want to keep going in college... but I think this is just me being a bit sentimental about a period of time which I won't be able to live through again.

My college career was filled with a lot of uncertainties and doubts, as well as a lot of slacking after working hard for a year or two. Â I learned a few extremely good lessons, things which ultimately turned my life from being asocial to being much more social, and then I learned more things which subdued my demeanor quite a bit. Â But overall, I've learned a lot about myself over these past five years (and I've learned a lot, of course, from my classes), and I wouldn't give up these five years for <em>anything</em>. Â I'm sure everyone who has been through college would say the same thing about the whole experience.

The truth of the matter is, I totally lost myself almost two years ago or so. Â Before that, I was an extremely nerdy kid who spent all of his time on homework and didn't know any better about how to socialize. Â I eventually learned how to socialize, went into my first relationship, then I've started to downspiral following the breakup. Â I honestly think that that was my watershed moment, where I honestly started to give some thought about who I was, what I was doing, and what was actually important in life. Â I was already trying to change myself before getting into my first relationship, but after getting hit with what seemed like a ton of bricks at the time, I was wondering if this sort of change was actually something that was mostly genuine. Â And I think, now, all of this changing, thinking about my life, etc. has culminated into me getting back into what I used to do: doing crap with computers. Â I've also learned to welcome back my old self and cherish it. Â This is probably why I'm clamoring to get out of college: because I know, now, exactly what I love doing.

But I also have some lingering regrets, which, when combined with my sentiments about these past five years, shows a somewhat better picture as to why I want to stay in college. Â For instance, I failed A LOT of math classes because I both didn't have the intellectual drive to actually put in the hours of work required for the classes, and I also wasn't in the right place in my life at that time. Â If I had time and money, I would absolutely <em>love</em>Â to stay in college and retake those classes now that I have a little bit more clarity in my life. Â I also regret the worst quality about me, which is my laziness; I loved the subjects, but I had no <em>tenacity</em>Â when it came down to actually doing the work. Â And that, I think, was also what killed me in my college career.

In any case, I'm going to miss college. Â I've learned a lot in my courses, finally found a solid starting point for the rest of my life, and I've made a lot of good friends as well.

Two and a half more months until I'm out of this joint!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I've been thinking about what I should possibly do after I graduate. Â I'm hoping that I can get a full time entry level / junior level position in IT, but the job market is looking real terrible right now. Â I was also thinking about graduate school, maybe in something like statistics. Â But how everything will line up, I don't know. . .

One possible choice is to work a little bit in IT for a year, apply to graduate school, and get a masters degree in, say, statistics. Â Another possible choice is to simply go right into IT and just stay there until I turn blue in the face. Â It's just the graduate school part that's a little distressing for me; my grades simply suck and I don't know if any department around here in Seattle would want to take me in. Â My set theory professor suggested that I talk to the statistics department here, but the only problem is that I don't have demonstrable probability and statistics skills (I've never bothered to take MATH 394 / 395 at all, and I'm starting to realize how much of a mistake that was.) Â AnÂ acquaintanceÂ suggested that I check out the engineering disciplines, as they apparently are in want of people with a decent math background with no prior engineering experience required.

I think, maybe, it was a good thing that I didn't apply to grad school yet. Â I could use a break in order to sort everything out in my head. . .]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a bit of a conundrum; maybe some of you guys who are involved in teaching could convince me otherwise.

I love teaching stuff to other people in whatever capacity that I can muster.Â  Seeing people finally understand a concept that I've been trying to teach in many different angles is simply fucking awesome.

However, I've been reading <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/muddle-machine">a few</a> <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html">articles</a>, <a href="http://www.wheresthemath.com/blog2/">websites</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymvSFunUjx0">watched</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr1qee-bTZI&amp;feature=channel_page">a lot</a> of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyHER6o-4x0&amp;feature=channel_page">videos</a> on the realities of K-12 education in the United States (especially on mathematics education, something which I was thinking about going into), and to me, the entire system seems to be a huge monster of mediocrity, disallowing anyone (teachers, textbook editors, students) from presenting any sort of ingenuity.

I remember learning from those god awful textbooks that the first link describes.Â  When was it ever interesting for someone to write multiple steps in order to solve a math problem involving an ice cream man?Â  I suppose the textbook editors / writers are trying to show us how "useful" and "fun" math can be, but all they are doing is constraining us to a set of banal examples which only restricts our world view on how applicable math can be.

But you might think about this and say, "well, kids really would be lost if you lay the heavy math on them!Â  How can X, Y, or Z be useful if it can't be translated into a problem that kids can understand?"Â  I'm inclined to think that if we do not give any intellectual charity to these kids, then they will either become frustrated or will become constrained within the bounds that we've set up for them.Â  For instance, I remember matrices being introduced in one of my high school math classes just because the curriculum demanded that the kids needed to learn the largest amount of concepts as possible.Â  However, the usage of matrices never amounted to anything more than simply learning how to actually add and multiply them together; how surprised I was to learn several years later that there was a lot of "deep" results to be had with matrices that could have been "dumbed down" a little bit for high school consumption.Â  For instance, any linear transformation can be represented as a matrix.Â  Rotations are linear transformations (thus, it can be represented as a matrix).Â  Multiplying two rotations together is another rotation.Â  These things, as intuitive and easy as they sound, have far reaching consequences, both in the theory and in applications (if you had a student in a high school class who was interested in math and in computer games, just tell them that all of the fancy 3D graphics rendering has to do with matrices).

In a lot of ways, I think school textbooks should be written by a few key authors with no constraints whatsoever, <em>just like in college</em>.Â  College textbooks written by a few people <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/muddle-machine#comment-60303">end up having less errors</a>, anyway.

The problem doesn't end here, however.Â  The textbook market is simply a part of a larger problem in our education system.Â  The strict adherence to a district wide curriculum is also troublesome, though I know that some of the better teachers often drift away from such a constraint while staying within the standard.Â  Imagine if literature classes were taught out of a heavily edited anthology, so that it contains none of the more "colorful" authors and none of the politically incorrect works from famous authors!Â  We would, again, be constrained in safety from such works, so that our minds would not be polluted with such subversive thoughts!Â  Imagine if we had to teach creationism as <em>science</em> (it's not, for the mere fact that it is not falsifiable; it belongs in a philosophy course, not in science.)

In any case, I really would love to teach, but I fear that the public school system would hold me to the fire if I didn't comply with the culture of mediocrity that they've bred in the United States.

Maybe you guys can give some insight in this?]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hmm, I'm definitely down for meeting up, though it'd have to be after finals are done.

I'm convinced that there is a curiosity in kids that must be fostered.  However, at least in math, this curiosity is simply _murdered_; check out this article to see what I mean: http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf

Most people I talk to about math think that math is the only field where you can only have one correct answer.  And while that can be true, it all depends on the assumptions that we lay out on the table before engaging in the problem.  For instance, the "fact" that "2 + 2 = 4" is true, because we are working with the axioms and theorems of plain arithmetic.  However, it is also true that "2 + 2 = 0", when working with mod 4 arithmetic (that is, if we imagine adding 1 to a number as rotating a square from corner to corner, then when we add enough times to get up to the quantity "4", we return back to where we started: 0.)

That, and there is a theorem by Godel which basically says, "given our assumptions, if we can express things that include at least arithmetic, there is at least one thing in our system that we cannot prove nor disprove."  Well shit.  This basically shows that mathematics can't EVER be put in a solid enough ground so that we can _always_ prove "p" and not prove "not p".

Anyway, what I'm basically saying is that the current curriculum casts math in a really bad position: that it is the arbiter of truth, that it always gets you "the one true answer," etc.  The meat of mathematics is in creativity, and this, unfortunately, has been totally removed from K-12 mathematics.

I would say that the most depressing thing is that many people go on to other pursuits because "they are bad at math."  I'm not saying that it's not worthwhile to pursue history in lieu of math, but the fact of the matter is that the math that they teach in K-12 (and in the first year of college) is NOT nearly the same as actual mathematics.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey man, I think you'll find that teaching K-12 will be more of a struggle with classroom management/behavior problems rather than the actual content baring ingenuity. I taught K-5 for one year and you have no idea how smart these kids are and how aware they are of the world around them (far more than our generation). It really made me appreciate what my teachers had gone through when they were teaching elementary school.

I taught science, and yes, I know exactly what you mean. All the projects needed to have a "fun" element behind them or else the class would never listen. I think the content delivery and personality also has a lot to do with it. My kids used to call me "Mr. Z" and hanging out with them was fun, but oftentimes I found myself frustrated at the end of the day when they went home with a project completed but understood little to nothing on the actual subject matter.

Anyways, I have a lot more to talk about this so if you'd like, drop me an email sometime or maybe we can meet up. Have you also considered Literacy AmeriCorps?

So, I've been trying to figure out how to code the game "Breakout" from scratch as an exercise in game development.Â  One of the things that I've been trying to flesh out is how to model the behavior of the ball as it hits the different parts of the paddle.Â  For one, the ball should change it's angle so that it travels more to the left (if it hits the left side of the paddle) or more to the right (if it hits the right side).Â  Second, if it hits the "dead zone" in the center, then the angle should be preserved (so the "dead zone" will be a few pixels wide, so that the player doesn't have to be super precise when he wants the ball to travel with the same direction.)Â  Third, if we are representing the ball's motion with a vector, then the "x-axis" vector (I put "x-axis" in quotes for a reason, which will be explained in a little bit) should not change, while the "y-axis" vector will be flipped in direction (so if the ball was traveling down and left, then the ball will still travel left, but will now be traveling up instead.)

Using a bit of geometry and trig, we want the y-axis vector to be multiplied by -1 so that the orientation is flipped (analogous to reflecting the ball's motion vector over the y-axis, and drawing the arrow away from the origin, rather than toward the origin):

[caption id="attachment_235" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Simple reflection"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-235" title="Diagram 1" src="http://blog.redbluemagenta.com/wp-content/uploads/dia1-300x112.gif" alt="Simple reflection" width="300" height="112" />[/caption]

But what should the ball's behavior be when it hits the paddle to the left or to the right of the dead zone?Â  We want the y-axis vector to flip AND reduce in magnitude, plus we want the x-axis vector to proportionally increase in magnitude:

[caption id="attachment_236" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Hitting the paddle&#39;s edge"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-236" title="Hitting Paddle Edge" src="http://blog.redbluemagenta.com/wp-content/uploads/dia2-300x112.gif" alt="Hitting the paddle's edge" width="300" height="112" />[/caption]

So I figured that we could do this fairly easily if we imagined drawing a "collision plane" and it's corresponding normal vector, so that instead of reflecting over an absolute y-axis, we reflect over the plane's normal vector:

[caption id="attachment_237" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Collision plane reflection"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-237" title="Collision Plane" src="http://blog.redbluemagenta.com/wp-content/uploads/dia3-300x112.gif" alt="Collision plane reflection" width="300" height="112" />[/caption]

The math is probably messier than keeping everything in terms of the xy-plane (I haven't worked it out quite yet), but it would generalize nicely when we consider all possible collisions along the paddle.

So, here's what I imagine how some of the collision planes would look like when we are considering the possible ways that the ball could hit the paddle:

[caption id="attachment_238" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Hey look, collision planes"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-238" title="Collision Plane Enumeration" src="http://blog.redbluemagenta.com/wp-content/uploads/dia4-300x112.gif" alt="Hey look, collision planes" width="300" height="112" />[/caption]

So the corners of the paddle would have a collision plane tilted about 45 degrees in relation to the xy-plane, and the angle it makes with the xy-plane scales down toward 0 degrees when we move closer toward the dead zone.

However, I think there's still a few problems with this model.Â  For one, I need to play the game a bit more in order to get the behavior right. :pÂ  Second, there could be problems with the ball bouncing totally parallel to the line that it travels on, even if the ball's motion vector is going toward the edge of the paddle (I don't know if this is really a problem, though.)

I think next time, I'll try to talk about how to go about modeling more of the possible collisions and modeling some of the game logic.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I suppose I should write something about this topic.

These five years have been pretty awesome; I've learned a lot about many different subjects and developed a lot of appreciation for topics that I've never thought I'd be interested in. Â For instance, I've learned to appreciate literature in different ways than I've ever imagined, from learning about the ties between "Frankenstein" and the movie "Blade Runner," to learning about (I think) the differences between an act (or duty?) and a wish, both with the novel "War and Peace" and with the lineup of films by Stanley Kubrick (I'll have to thank Willis Konick for that, he was probably one of my most favorite professors that I've had the pleasure of taking two classes from.)

My conception of what math was all about was thoroughly smashed apart by the time I got to my sophomore year as well. Â And after that happened, my interest in it only increased. Â I hadn't done all too well, but my interest has been fairly steady, and I think I wouldn't have been acquainted with the subject all too well if I hadn't forced myself to go through the classes.

I also thought that I wasn't all too interested in philosophy when I started taking it at the UW, though the logic and set theory classes sucked me in. Â (When I started taking classes in philosophy, I had Leroy Searle's "Method, Imagination and Inquiry" in mind the entire time; I felt like I was left disappointed when I saw that most classes weren't about some sort of historical narrative when it came to stringing together the different philosophical positions in each class.)

But other than academic stuff, I've also learned a lot about myself and about the world around me. Â I've probably changed the most as a person during these past five years and broke apart many misconceptions I've had about the world... sorta. Â Well, I feel that I'm at least in a better spot when it comes to critically looking at my own position and other's positions and <em>maybe</em> coming to some sort of conclusion. Â But overall, I've at least started experiencing the world in a much bigger way than I've ever had before. Â I've met a lot of great people with friendships coming and going and had quite a few memorable experiences that I wouldn't trade with anything.

Overall, I've become a hell of a lot more curious about the world and I've started to temper myself into becoming a better person. Â I think that's what's college is about: it's training us to become more curious about the world and develop ourselves into better citizens. Â I don't think it's necessarily about getting ourselves into a career path, since all of us start on the bottom once we leave college; we learn to be <em>curious</em>, which opens us up for more learning.

Anyway, it's been a great five years, and I'm glad to be through with the whole damn thing. Â Maybe graduate school will be in the horizon sometime soon...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is mostly for my own knowledge, and probably not for hardcore scientific applications.Â  Why am I asking this question in the first place, then?Â  Because I'm trying to figure out whether it's worthwhile in maybe building a super cheap (and hopefully low power) Beowulf cluster to run at home in order to learn more about the nuances of such a configuration.Â  I've been reading an ebook on the motivations behind building such a beast in the first place, and though of course it helps enormously in running scientific data through the cluster, I'm largely untrained when it comes to any sort of science.

So... what the hell can I do with a (hobbyist) Beowulf cluster?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After a few conversations with Phillip about the whole cat-recognition problem thing, I've decided to do a bit of reading in a book I bought a few weeks ago, as well as some light research on Wikipedia on computer vision. Â Well, it didn't take long for me to hit upon a few helpful articles:

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform">SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) Algorithm</a>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians">Difference of Gaussians</a>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_recognition">Object Recognition</a>

The only problem is that when we are considering a live, breathing cat, we probably wouldn't see much of any clean linear transformations in the space we're working with (imagine a cat who curls up in a ball from a standing position.) Â But there's still a lot more reading I have to do about this stuff before I can say any more about it...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After building a Beowulf cluster from scratch at my work, I've learned a lot of things about how to setup a Beowulf cluster successfully using OSCAR and a lot about how to avoid problems in the future.Â  I've ran into a ton of issues with pushing software across an internal network to a bunch of nodes, mainly because the slave nodes in a Beowulf cluster typically have no access to the internet.Â  Thus, it's a little tricky when it comes to package management; you can either setup iptables rules on your head node in order to have it act as a NAT, or you can download whatever packages you will need (including all of the dependencies) and store them in a single directory.Â  I chose the latter because I don't want any of my slave nodes in my cluster to have access to the internets.Â  However, what's the easiest way to deploy a bunch of packages for a bunch of compute nodes in a cluster?

Well, it depends.Â  I found out that NFS shares are paramount for a working cluster installation, mainly because all of the nodes will need to run the same exact program and will need to analyze the same exact set of files as every other node.Â  I've learned this the hard way while trying to deploy <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/corra/">Corra</a>, which is a Bioinformatics tool for analyzing mass spectrometry data.Â  However, I also figure that it helps when you have a good proportion of the packages installed in default directories.Â  Thus, I install system libraries on every single node, and I share proteomics-related software via NFS.

As for actually setting up and administering the cluster, I use <a href="http://svn.oscar.openclustergroup.org/trac/oscar">OSCAR</a>. [Note: do not get the latest version, they do not call their versions "development" and "stable," but rather, "latest" and "old."Â  The "old" version on their downloads page is also outdated: the latest stable release is actually 5.1rc1, which you can find on their <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/oscar/files/">SourceForge page</a>.]Â  OSCAR is great once it's set up, but it can be a little bit of a pain when you're starting out for the first time with an OSCAR installation.Â  First of all, I would use only one MPI implementation: LAM/MPI is great.Â  Second, you'll really have to do some research into what sort of programs you'll be running on your cluster.Â  For instance, Corra requires PBS/Torque as the queueing system.Â  OSCAR offers both PBS/Torque and Sun Grid Engine as queueing systems while you're going through the installation, yet you can't install both of them at the same time.Â  Oh, and if you're going with PBS/Torque, install maui as well.Â  It's a pretty good job scheduler.

In any case, OSCAR is a great package to use if you're planning on building / administering a cluster with MPI.Â  It comes with a ton of great tools and makes it super easy to incorporate / delete nodes in your cluster.Â  I don't know much about SSI clusters at all, and I doubt I will anytime soon, since most proteomics applications I've seen so far seem to favor clusters setup with MPI.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have always wanted to experiment a little more with multiple OS integration in a computer network. Â It seems that Active Directory is what's driving most networks these days, and while there might be opposition against a multi-OS environment on any side of the debate, it's a hell of a lot better to factor other operating systems into the equation. Â But why would one want to do that, if say most of the users were used to either Linux/BSD or Windows?

It's mostly because it allows for a lot more flexibility. Â I'm thinking that if there was an appropriate infrastructure that could support different types of operating systems (and perhaps the right culture to allow for it as well), it would be much easier to come up with fixes for certain problems. Â Of course it won't all be elegant as most admins would probably love to have it. Â For instance, say there is an AD network at a corporate office, and say they host a website on their own servers. Â You could, of course, keep it all Windows-based and make everything easy to manage from AD. Â However, as we should all know, IIS is riddled with security holes, and so it's absolute suicide to go Windows-based all the way, <em>depending on what services you run</em>. Â That is to say, if you don't host a web server, then it's probably a-okay to simply run everything on a Windows server.

But what about low-level services that provides essential information for client computers, like DHCP, DNS, etc.? Â From what little I've read, it's also quite unwise to run these sorts of services from a Windows server; most of these things, at least in ISPs, are run from a *BSD box (or sometimes even a Linux box). Â But if you are running an AD network, you don't have to throw the entire baby out with the bath water if you choose to run these services on a *nix box. Â I don't know exactly how one would implement such a setup, but from a few quick glances at Google results, it's definitely possible to do. Â What I would love to do is to setup a primary DNS server on AD (so that all of the niceties of administrating an AD setup is still there) and then setup secondary and tertiary DNS servers on two FreeBSD boxes. Â I've heard success stories, but I'm still a little leeryÂ about the implementation details and whether it would break other services, like Exchange or whatever.

In any case, a multi-OS environment would at least balance out some of the strengths and weaknesses of each (server) OS on a network. Â Active Directory seems to be an <em>excellent</em> way of organizing a network into a hierarchy which mirrors the actual meatspace organization in a company. Â However, for anything that has to do with interaction with the internets -Â <em>especially</em> low-level services - it is a hell of a lot better to go with *nix machines.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been with <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=8bc45a7ce694f24356ff5e8e62177650598f9ab1">Linode</a> for about two days now.  I can't say anything but good things about them when it comes to an unmanaged Linux box.  They provide a VPS (Virtual Private Server) which they call a "Linode," and each Linode is sitting on top of a Xen hypervisor.  I've subscribed to the Linode 720 plan, which grants 720 MB of guaranteed memory to the VPS, 32 GB of HD space, and about 400 GB of transfer per month.</p>

<p>I have heard about the pros and cons of a VPS versus, say, a shared web hosting account, and a dedicated server, namely that a VPS often has to compete for resources and it's often simply used if you want root level access to a box without necessarily expecting the greatest amount of available resources.  However, my Linode has been churning away quite happily on a fairly unoptimized installation of Apache 2 and MySQL 5, which are the usual memory eaters in a server.  In fact, I've heard of stories of people running <em>game servers</em> on even the lowest priced Linodes, which is typically unheard of in any other VPS solution; any other VPS, from hearsay at least, is usually oversubscribed and often competes for computer resources, especially for disk i/o access.  Linode.com seems to have either tweaked their Xen hypervisor installs to be quite generous in keeping the servers responsive, or they do not oversubscribe (or both!)  I'll have to experiment with running a Half-Life 2 server to see how much I can stretch the resources in my VPS.</p>

<p>I've gotten my hands dirty with both shared hosting and an unmanaged server; a shared web hosting account is definitely cheap and it depends on which provider you go for, but it's ultimately insufficient if you want to have root level access to a box, and also if you want to have 99.99% uptime for your website.  What's great about shared hosting, however, is that they often host the sites on pretty decent hardware, even if it's being oversubscribed.  A dedicated server is quite costly, usually consists of subpar outdated hardware, and will, more often than not, be underutilized.</p>

<p>A VPS seems to be the best of both worlds: there's a lot of customers on one computer, yet offers the capabilities of a dedicated server.  Thus, more often than not, the VPS is hosted on a box with, say, twenty or thirty other customers, with the box usually featuring multiple CPU's and a robust array of hard drives.  On my VPS hosted by Linode.com, they use a quad core Xeon L5520 clocked at 2.26 GHz and a RAID-10 array of hard drives.  Further, each Linode/VPS on each box has access to all four CPU's for multithreading.</p>

<p>As for Linode.com's unique features, there's a nice web frontend for deploying distributions on the hard drive (which by the way, if you wanted to wipe your entire installation and wanted to deploy a new distribution, only about five minutes) and for managing DNS records.  Also, they provide out of band login to your machine via SSH without having direct network access to your box.  This has saved my ass many times; I've ended up toasting an Arch Linux installation and was able to recover the installation via their out of band SSH interface.  They also provide graphs of network traffic, CPU usage, and disk i/o.  Speaking of disk i/o:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/xvda
/dev/xvda:
 Timing cached reads:   9414 MB in  1.99 seconds = 4721.44 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  382 MB in  3.00 seconds = 127.33 MB/sec
</code></pre>

<p>Not bad.  I haven't done too much other testing yet, other than briefly running a 24 slot TF2 server.  However, I took it down after calculating how much bandwidth would be required each month in order to run such a server; I think it would be much safer to run a single 4 or 8 player L4D server.</p>

<p>In any case, I highly recommend Linode.com to anyone who wants to host a website or run a light game server (or any other server application) without breaking the bank.  I've personally subscribed to the Linode 720 plan, which is PLENTY for me to work with.  I actually host this website and another domain with the same Linode; I'm potentially going to open a Left 4 Dead server on this box as well.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, I've transitioned my website over to <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=8bc45a7ce694f24356ff5e8e62177650598f9ab1">Linode.com</a>, which is working out extremely well for me.  Second, I've opened up my <a href="http://www.redbluemagenta.com">front page</a> to the public finally, which showcases my portfolio and my resume.</p>

<p>Anyway, getting to the meat of this post, I've been meaning to rant for a while about vendor lock-in.  As a person working more on the technical side of things than on the management / business side, I've felt extremely frustrated when I'm locked in with a specific vendor; this means that my creativity as a problem solver is similarly boxed in as well.  Yes, I am a Linux advocate, but I use whatever is best for particular situations; for instance, I believe that Windows Servers are great for directory services.  However, it makes no sense to me to stick only with one platform simply because we've paid money for the whole thing.</p>

<p>For instance, there are common server applications on Linux which are much superior to anything that the Windows platform could offer, like Apache, Tomcat, Nagios, Cacti, RT, etc.  Granted, the first two applications are ported over to Windows, but Microsoft insists on an all Windows deployment: this means sticking with IIS.  The last three applications are, in fact, enterprise grade pieces of software.  And they are all free!</p>

<p>In any case, because Linux is free as in freedom, and since most, if not all of the apps are free as in freedom as well, there are no contracts or upfront fees to pay.  For an organization, it might require additional skilled personnel well versed in Linux, and it may require purchasing of support from some other vendor.  It may even require paying for training.  But if there's something broken in the software, then either the IT department fixes it, or they replace it at will.  There are no budget limitations after the initial costs are out of the way.  This is why I do not like vendor lock-in; it does not allow me to consider the last option, which is to replace the software quickly in order to fix the problem.  I simply want to get things done, and sometimes, deploying and culling workstations/servers/software/whatever at-will must be an option for me if I want to fix the issue, and sometimes it will have to be OSS software, which often has no vendor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a help desk technician, I sometimes forget about some of the issues when it comes to managing staff, budgets, and other things of that sort.  Usually I strive for technically excellent solutions which make sense for the end user, and when such a thing does not exist, I try to at least get the end user to be as productive as possible at the lowest level possible (does the computer turn on, can I type and save my reports, etc.)</p>

<p>However, as part of my job function, I also take an interest in the health of the infrastructure, as sometimes the lower level issues may stem from a problem in the infrastructure itself.  For instance, imagine the end user attempting to access the internet.  She sees a "page not found" error.  Uh oh, maybe she hasn't pulled an IP address from the DHCP server, or maybe the DNS server is down; then I'll be pulled away from the problem and see the same exact thing from Joe's computer.  So now I am lead to think that either the DHCP or DNS server has gone down, or that the wiring in a particular section of the building is faulty.</p>

<p>To make it easier on everyone, I want to strike off as many scenarios from my mental list as possible.  Sometimes, this requires setting up an additional server which acts either as a failover server or as a primary server for a particular service (obviously, I can't do this while the two people from the scenario above are flailing their arms around trying to get their work done, so I'd have to of course come up with a stop gap solution for both of them.  Let's assume, from now on, that I've already implemented such a solution for those two people.)  Occasionally, the best solution is one that employs either FreeBSD or Linux servers to provide the service (and yes, there is a use for Windows servers, I do not want to spread FUD about Windows servers); there is an extremely solid reputation for BSD/Linux servers when it comes to providing low level services, like DHCP, DNS, SMTP, etc.  However, this is often not enough for IT managers and other high level administrators, as there may be a bit of FUD surrounding the use of Linux as a server.  Here are some of the things that they may say:</p>

<ul>
<li>Linux is free, therefore it has no value for the enterprise.</li>
<li>There are no vendors to be accountable for our systems when they take a nose dive.</li>
<li>Linux has no security measures.</li>
<li>Linux is old.</li>
<li>Linux is written by a bunch of amateurs with no eye for business planning.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to convince administrators to allow for Linux servers to be placed on the network, we must be diplomats; we cannot simply talk about FOSS philosophy and denigrate the Windows platform as a closed system.  We also cannot talk about the technical merits of employing Linux as a tie-in with Windows servers, as higher level administrators often are worried about business decisions and training costs.</p>

<p>So how do we work around this?  Again, we work as diplomats, always understanding of the business impact: talk about how there is a lower TCO for Linux and do some research in order to confirm that this is indeed the case (Microsoft provided some questionable research in the TCO of Linux vs. Windows; even if this were true, I would be weary about it mostly because the research was not done independent of the company.)  Talk about how the average salary for a Linux sysadmin is a few more bucks per year, yet there is a much lower initial buy-in for software than Windows.  Talk about how it is not simply just a bunch of amateurs writing code for all of the applications and the kernel for free, but rather, there are many programmers employed by IBM, Red Hat, etc. who contribute to the entire ecosystem (and also, be prepared to talk about how Linux was based off of UNIX, which was around since the 60's.)  Talk about how Google, Amazon, IBM, etc. have based their entire infrastructure off of Linux and BSD, and how ecosystems and organizations like Wall Street, the French Police, etc. have been running on Linux and have saved money and time by running a free operating system.</p>

<p>But also, this requires some knowledge of the Windows ecosystem as well.  Do your research, setup Windows servers, and don't be totally ignorant as well.  I, personally, am ready to concede that Exchange and Active Directory are extremely good pieces of software that have helped organize email and the organization at large much better than anything I've seen on Linux so far.  But I know enough to know that it is absolute suicide to use Windows for anything that is mission critical.</p>

<p>In short, put yourself in the shoes of the IT manager and other administrators handling the budgets and try to think about what they are worried about.  They are worried about vendor support, training costs, etc. Then do your research and present an alternative as diplomatically as possible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was reading a <a href="http://www.o3magazine.com/0/7.html">great article</a> on <a href="http://o3magazine.com">o3magazine.com</a> about leveraging open source software as an overall strategy rather than as a replacement for a vendor.  This makes a lot of sense: though there are definitely open source vendors (for example, Red Hat) that can take over for closed source vendors, the best way OSS can be deployed as a cost effective alternative to Microsoft lock-in is to simply replace vendors with trained staff, and keep it people-centric rather than vendor-centric.  As soon as there are enough staff members, the cost of running open source software remains relatively flat; there is no additional software cost when the infrastructure scales up, and if the staff are relatively well trained, there is a slower increase of staff members depending on how many servers each staff member can maintain.</p>
<p>I always try to emphasize in all of my posts that I'm also trying to be realistic, especially with meeting users' needs first.  Sometimes this means biting the bullet and investing in vendors, especially if they offer a superior product that meets both the IT department's needs and the users' needs.  However, the quality of open source software, in what little experience I have with both closed and open source enterprise grade software, is gaining on closed source software quite a bit.  However, changing the entire business plan from dealing with vendors to embracing the essence of open source strategy seems to be a monumental task; not only is there the technical boundaries associated with migrating everything over to another product (which may not even integrate well with Windows clients), but also with simply holding a specific company accountable for any sort of bugs in the software, or even simply in IT department staffing and project implementation.  Instead of buying a package from a vendor that does X, Y, and Z, you have to rely on the in-house team in order to put together a solution from many different pieces that does exactly X, Y, and Z.  Yes, this does take away time from maintenance and whatnot, but there are pitfalls that would be avoided with this style compared to buying commercial COTS, providing there was a sufficiently decent staff in the IT department:</p>
<ul>
<li>There would be no vendor lock-in.</li>
<li>Since there is no vendor lock-in, the emphasis is on technical ability rather than on marketing.</li>
<li>There is a greater chance for the ship to be run much tighter than in Windows-only shops, since the technicians and engineers know the system inside and out (there is a possible caveat to this: the technicians and engineers must be willing to train each other in what they did.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, there is, in reality, a lot more support for most popular open source software than a lot of vendor closed source software.  Though there is sometimes no central vendor to take accountability for the code quality of the software (most of the time, support can be bought for open source software anyway), there are swaths of mailing lists and forums dedicated to these pieces of software.  And in fact, if you post on the mailing list or forum of the software in question, there is often a response straight from the developer (or other experienced sysadmins) regarding the issue, with most of these people even taking into account your entire server and network configuration.  Further, code quality in open source software is often quite high: OSS is peer reviewed software fueled often by the passion of the programmers in question.</p>
<p>I'll try to stop posting so much about how OSS > closed source, since I also want to concede the point that I am not a manager and have almost no business acumen.  But in terms of OSS technical merits, it has come a long way and, in many cases, totally trumps closed source software.  Just ask Google, Amazon, and the entire internet infrastructure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here is my tentative plan: setup a VMWare private network with four or five virtual machines running at once.  I'll setup one OpenBSD firewall, one *BSD router/DNS server (not sure which BSD quite yet, probably OpenBSD), one FreeBSD mail server, one Solaris web server, and one Slackware NFS file server just for kicks.  I've also been writing up little bash, sed, and perl scripts at my current job in order to help sift through text files and spit back anything useful for either me or anyone else outside of the IT department.

After having a couple of brief forays into FreeBSD from a comfortable position in Linux, I still found myself at sea; there are enough things that are different in FreeBSD that can make it a little difficult to navigate at first.  I also figure that there are enough things that are different between Solaris and FreeBSD that would throw me off as well.  In any case, I want to get as close to the original Unixes as possible without breaking the bank (it's not like I can get my hands on an HP-UX server like magic.)  Solaris and FreeBSD might be the closest to the original UNIX source code as possible; Linux complies with POSIX standards but is simply a bastard child to UNIX at best.  Also, most of the BSD's (as far as I know) use csh or ksh as a default shell, and not bash (hell, I don't even think bash is even in the base system by default, it's probably a "port" at best.)

Anyway, that's all I have so far. :D]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm attempting to follow a career path to becoming a UNIX sysadmin.  On paper, it sounds like the most rewarding profession out of everything I've looked at, and I already love administering and deploying Linux/BSD systems, though I've only had to deal with maybe ten privately networked nodes in a Beowulf cluster at most.  I've started to install four *NIX operating systems in VMWare Workstation, such as OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Slackware, and Solaris (and maybe I'll add another Slackware server via PXE boot), all of them taking on different roles in a virtualized network.  I've been adding in more and more Debian boxes at my current job to do different fringe roles; one of them acts as an imaging server, another one acts as a network monitoring box, and I'm hoping to add another box as a test box for different web applications.</p>

<p>There's a hell of a lot to learn, though I'm finding that it's extremely satisfying to figure how something works in a UNIX environment.</p>

<p>I've ordered three books so far in order to aid me in this task: "The Practice of System and Network Administration" by Limoncelli, "UNIX System Administration Handbook" by Nemeth, and "Principles of Network and System Administration" by Burgess.  These books are heavily recommended by <a href="http://sage.org">SAGE</a>.  However, there does not seem to be much of anything in terms of a traditional career path to becoming a UNIX sysadmin: most stories I have read about usually involves someone who happened to know UNIX in the right place at the right time, and informally became the sysadmin of a particular department.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's my career goal so far, and I figure that it will take me a few years in order to get to that point.  We'll see.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm doing a bit of consulting on the side for a small business in Seattle, and I'm tasked with coming up with a proposal for improving the reliability of their wifi network (which could mean anything between the internet and the user's laptop, including the network gateway, wifi AP capacity, etc.), and ultimately implementing all of the hardware and software.  As I have probably said before, I'm mostly on the technical side of IT rather than the business side, so this will expose me more to the business side of things.

On the technical side, the plan is to make sure that the network has close to 100% uptime during business hours.  Between the gateway and the internet, we can look at whether the routes to the typical services are reliable; this means looking at the next hop (at the very least), the ISP provided DNS servers, etc.  I typically change the DNS servers over to 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.2, and 4.2.2.3, which are all provided by Level 3 (this is of course dependent on the circumstances, we might have to setup a local DNS server for any name resolutions for in-house servers.)  Between the gateway and any other device, we will want to make sure that the connection between the gateway and whatever other device physically exists right after the gateway does not get saturated.  If it does, we would probably have to look either at any switches in between the gateway and any other device, install more routers in order to limit the data that hits the gateway, or install a firewall and simply block certain packets from going through.  Since this particular deployment will most likely not saturate a 1 Gbps connection on the gateway, we will only put a switch right after the gateway and turn on basic QoS just in case.

Next, since this is a wifi deployment, we will have to worry about wifi capacity on each access point, not to mention any possibility of crosstalk between APs.  Without getting into details of doing a site survey and identifying any blind spots or whatever, we would have to know the real world capacity of each AP, and deploy accordingly.  We expect maybe 30-40 clients on the entire network at any given time, spread out between two different floors and separated by concrete.  So at the very least, we need two or three APs to cover both floors.  From what I've seen, there's at least fifteen laptops open at any given time on the first floor, with the first floor separated by brick between two rooms.  Therefore, we will need two AP's at the very least in the first floor, with maybe a third AP in order to make sure we cover every corner of both rooms.  Let's say that there are ten people in one room that are all connected on 802.11g.  Realistically, we can expect a throughput of 35 Mbps per client; therefore, we can expect the throughput to be around 300-350 Mbps total on one AP; if the AP has a 1 Gbps interface, then this is quite good, though I might be missing a few details.

However, if we are to consider a 802.11n deployment, then we will be be expecting about 70-150 Mbps throughput in the best conditions, with a theoretical maximum of 300 Mbps.  This will hit the 1 Gbps interface at around 700 Mbps-1500 Mbps of throughput, which might become a problem; this is also all assuming that we will be deploying AP's without much centralized control.  This would pose a problem in this particular case if there is a lot of peer to peer activity within the network, yet if we are assuming that about half of the users will simply use the internet, then this will soften the load considerably.

On the business side, there will have to be an SLA in place between me and the business, as well as a clear outline of what is to be provided, how it will be deployed, and deadlines on the various phases of the deployment.  Further, I will have to audit their current network and ensure that the deployment will have a noticeable increase in reliability and speed.  Again, I don't know whether I am missing anything; I need to work on the business side a bit more.

Anyway, hopefully this sheds a bit of light on my own line of thinking, and I hope that it falls somewhat the standards of network deployment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I was trying to install Arch Linux with a 2009.08 ISO image that was imaged onto a USB stick with UNetBootin.  After trying to boot it up on the laptop I was trying to install Arch Linux on, it kept kicking me into the ramfs$ prompt after timing out on mounting /dev/archiso (the exact error message before it kicked me into the shell was "Waiting 30 seconds for the device /dev/archiso".)  However, it isn't automatically created; you have to create a soft link to /dev/archiso from the block device that your USB stick is assigned to.  For instance, I saw that my USB stick was /dev/sdb (simply from going into /dev, and then typing 'echo *' [since there is no ls command in ramfs for whatever reason] and seeing that /dev/sdb had only one partition).  And then I created a soft link between /dev/sdb1 and /dev/archiso:</p>

<pre><code>ramfs$ ln -sf /dev/sdb1 /dev/archiso
ramfs$ exit</code></pre>

After logging out of the shell, the installer was able to find /dev/archiso (obviously) and continue on with the boot routines.  Hopefully this helps anyone else out there who is experiencing the same issues.]]></content:encoded>

Still, I was unable to complete the procedure since right after exiting the shell the kernel got stuck (kernel panic). It complains that the file system on /dev/archiso wasn't correct (can't remember the exact error message though).]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a few considerations that I'll lay on the table first, which influence my decision (and motivate the reasons why I'm having a dilemma as well):</p>
<ol>
<li>I want solid RAID support for four equal sized hard drives.  ZFS is the most ideal filesystem for me to use, but it is only really supported in FreeBSD and Solaris.</li>
<li>Desktop responsiveness is key.</li>
<li>I want nVidia 64-bit drivers for 3D acceleration, just in case I decide to play a bunch of games off of Steam.  This somewhat rules out FreeBSD in the meantime, but there is promise for 64-bit drivers in the near future.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now here is my dilemma: after working with OpenBSD and FreeBSD, I generally love the BSD way of doing things; for instance, all of the BSD's are extremely elegant in implementation and typically strive for technical excellence, which shows in how everything is implemented in the base system (for instance, do you want sound to work? kldload snd_foobar.  Want sound to work with multiple applications?  sysctl dev.pcm.0.play.vchans=4.  It is MUCH better to deal with than ALSA and PulseAudio.)  However, the only BSD that would have a chance as a viable desktop for me (FreeBSD) seems to somewhat fall through when it comes to having, say, RAID-Z as a boot drive (though I also hear this is an issue on OpenSolaris, too.)  I can't spare any extra SATA ports for a mirrored zpool for a boot drive, so I might just have to make do with what little I have on that front.  That, and I can't seem to get my X-Fi Forte to work with OSS4 on FreeBSD, either.</p>

<p>A lot of the hardware I have owned and used to own have, well, worked in Linux just fine.  But I do say that with slight reservation, as I had a lot less trouble with OpenSolaris and *BSD when it came to hardware support that <strong>worked well.</strong>  A lot of Linux distributions can also be needlessly complicated as well; while I do admire Debian's massive cleanup of the /etc directory and the massive amounts of example configuration files and comments in each script and configuration file, the niceties can be a bit of a double-edged sword: more often than not, I either have to scroll through a wall of text (when I could've just looked at all of that information in a man page or an FAQ) or work strictly with the built-in scripts (of course you don't HAVE to, but to keep everything nice and tidy within the system that is already setup, it can be a bit of a hassle.)  But hell, the Linux kernel has come a long way, though I believe there is still a terrible bug with large file transfers since 2.6.18: as soon as a large file transfer has started and sustains for a few minutes, the CPU usage spikes all the way up to 100+%.  This is unacceptable for any sort of desktop environment.</p>

<p>I have not had too much experience with OpenSolaris, but the deal breaker in this case is that there are not enough packages to download off of their repositories.  However, a lot of the more exciting things have come from this project, such as dtrace and ZFS.  It'd be great to investigate further at the very least.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[First, I want to forewarn everyone that I do not have any experience in deploying HA clusters whatsoever, though I do have some experience in deploying HPC clusters; this is simply a thought experiment in discovering any sort of caveats and issues with HA clusters and what sort of things should be addressed in either policy or implementation.

The objective in deploying HA clusters is to help provide either full or N+1 redundancy for a service, where "service," in this case, means any sort of cohesive set of servers, applications, and monitoring systems that fulfills a promise to the customer (if the customer, for instance, wants a website servicing 100,000 unique hits per day that has 99.9% uptime, a web service could include some sort of reverse proxy in order to reduce the load on all servers, multiple servers that are either copies of each other and/or divided up depending on what task they are assigned, a firewall, and network monitoring systems in order to make sure that everything runs fine.)  Where HA clusters fit in this puzzle is where we need servers that are (close to) exact copies of each other.

In a small cluster, the interconnects between servers are often ethernet cables; this offers bandwidth up to 1000 Mbps, or around 500-700 Mbps throughput.  This is fine if there are either only a lot of changes to small files, or occasional changes to large files.  If, however, we are anticipating many changes to large files, then we will either have to delegate any sort of file storage to a SAN, or implement faster interconnects between the servers (using InfiniBand or maybe splitting the network load between several ethernet cables.)  However, this may not be an issue if we do not require all of the servers to have a consistent state with the main server; a scenario where this may be the case is where the main server handles all of the load until the moment when it goes down, which then it goes to another backup server to pick up the slack.

Another way that we can address state consistency is to only send the least amount of data that keeps a specific file / database consistent; that is, if say a text file contained a list of names on the main server, and another name was appended to the end of the file, we only send the difference between the original file and the subsequent change to the file, which will lessen interconnect bandwidth requirements but could also increase processing costs for the server computing the differences between files, depending on the complexity of figuring out the differences between files (it could be a database which requires calling a function that spits out the difference between the original state and the modified state.)

Anyway, this is mostly just for my information; these issues could all have been addressed in the past by either crafty SA's or vendors, it's just a matter of reading more about the state of the art.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(<a href="http://www.redbluemagenta.com/index.php/2010/05/12/life-as-a-junior-sysadmin-part-ii/">Here's the link to Part II.</a>)

<p>I'm finally relaxing more and more into my de facto role as a junior sysadmin at my current job.  So far, things are looking fairly messy; there's a lot of infrastructure that still needs to be built, especially setting up systems and network monitoring.  We're extremely blind until something breaks, which then we have to go out to the premise and bring the service back up.  I've been reading a few blogs and books, such as "<a href="http://www.everythingsysadmin.com/">Everything Sysadmin</a>" and "Practice of System and Network Administration"; one take away message so far is to move the sysadmin team away from dealing with systems issues reactively and more toward having awareness before a service breaks down completely (when I say completely, I mean the time when a service is unusable for any group of people for any given reason.)  I find that there's a lot of things to learn in this area, especially with just setting up stuff for collecting data via SNMP, syslog, etc.</p>

<p>Further, I've been working more and more toward improving processes in our day to day dealings with systems, especially when it comes to imaging computers (our tool of choice is using an unattended installation server with software from <a href="http://unattended.sf.net">unattended.sf.net</a>), automating actions, etc.  It seems a bit harder than it looks, especially when dealing with Windows servers; there seems to be a lot of things in Windows that cannot be automated in a standard way.</p>

<p>In any case, there's a long way to go to improve the health of our systems, but we're getting there slowly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been thinking about this just now: how awesome would it be to able to update my Wordpress site, a MediaWiki site, Facebook, etc. all in the command line (without using something as unwieldy as Emacs? :D)Â  I'm sure this is possible; in fact, I know it's possible with MediaWiki (WWW::Mediawiki::Client in CPAN provides a command line client called "mvs".)Â  However, it'd be great to, for instance, have a directory in /var/ or /home/user/sites/ for each social media site (like for instance, /home/user/sites/wp for Wordpress, /home/user/sites/mediawiki for MediaWiki, etc.)Â  Each of these directories would have flat text files containing new posts to add.Â  Then I could run a shell script that pushes these text files onto each respective site.

I'll have to sketch this out sometime, this could be an interesting project for me to work on.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm a junior systems administrator working mostly with BSD and Linux systems, especially with Debian, CentOS/RHEL, and OpenBSD.  I'm a member of <a href="http://sage.org">SAGE</a> and <a href="http://lopsa.org">LOPSA.</a>

Also, you might be wondering what "SAGE Level II" means: <a href="http://www.sage.org/field/jobs-descriptions.html">here's a list of job descriptions from SAGE</a>.

<h2>Specializations</h2>

I specialize in HPC administration and web services.  I've also fallen in love recently with modern configuration management tools, such as Puppet and other various tools.

<h2>Current Interests in Systems Administration</h2>

I'm currently interested in investigating more into self-healing networks and systems; while configuration management tools such as Puppet help to achieve this goal, what if there was an increased demand in a service that "wounds" the system in a way that usually requires manual intervention?  What we'd usually do is provision more systems and designate them in Puppet as specific servers; however, can we automate this step so that our tool of choice (or some other new tool) can auto-provision systems when there's an increased load on our service?  (I'd imagine that it'd require monitoring of specific metrics, along with a language that describes what the system should do in order to ease the load requirements; I could at least imagine a scenario when such a self-healing system for, say, a web service, can throw too many slave servers underneath a load balancer, or provision one too many load balancers for the amount of slave hosts.)

<h2>About Ian Paredes</h2>

I currently work for <a href="http://3tier.com">3TIER</a> as a systems administrator.  I also administer an OpenBSD router for Cafe Allegro with two other volunteer sysadmins.  I design a few websites as a hobby with XHTML and CSS, and I occasionally volunteer my time for various nonprofit and academic organizations, such as <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/critgame">The Critical Gaming Project</a> and <a href="http://noisefortheneedy.org">Noise for the Needy</a>.  I also program in Ruby as a hobby, and more often than not, they are usually apps on Ruby on Rails.

I figure this is a great opportunity for me to start fresh with a new site design and a new set of blog posts.  Instead of talking only about technical stuff, I'll talk about both that and the regular stuff I usually like talking about, like philosophy, mathematics, and other subjects.]]></content:encoded>

I currently work for <a href="http://3tier.com">3TIER</a> as a systems administrator.  I also administer an OpenBSD router for Cafe Allegro with two other volunteer sysadmins.  I design a few websites as a hobby with XHTML and CSS, and I occasionally volunteer my time for various nonprofit and academic organizations, such as <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/critgame">The Critical Gaming Project</a> and <a href="http://noisefortheneedy.org">Noise for the Needy</a>.  I also program in Ruby as a hobby, and more often than not, they are usually apps on Ruby on Rails.

I currently live in my hometown, Seattle, WA.  I live with my girlfriend, Sara; her dog, Riley; and my cat, Eve.

This site is a place where I write about my professional work and a few other topics that are of personal interest.  I'm still new to the field, though I hope to contribute a few technical articles here and there for those who are looking for a little bit of help.

<h2>About this site</h2>

redbluemagenta is hosted with <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> on a Debian Lenny <a href="http://prgmr.com">prgmr.com</a> virtual slice.  The design and code for the website theme was all done in vim, Dreamweaver, and TextMate with a pinch of Photoshop here and there.  For the entire development cycle, I've used <a href="http://git-scm.org">git</a> for source control and sharing source code between multiple machines.  I've employed @font-face on two fonts on this site for a consistent viewing experience.

I might be sharing my work as a BSD licensed theme, but there's a lot of extra work involved in removing any site-specific customizations from my particular theme installation.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>(Note: I don't have any experience with deploying such a setup, but I do have some experience with working in an environment where several *nix operating systems were being used, with a lot of legacy OS's living alongside newer versions; this is a discussion on a possible packaging format that can make the job of deploying packages a little bit easier for each architecture and for each version of an operating system.)</em>

When administering a computing system, it's very possible for each server to diverge in its prescribed system state very rapidly. Â We want to maintain some semblance of consistency in the system state so that we know that the service we are providing to the customer is delivered reliably and consistently (for instance, say we want to provide a web service with X response time and Y uptime; we'd have to make sure our system as a whole is serving the correct pages in a timely manner, and we also want to make sure that our system stays up as much as possible.) Â One step to this goal is to provide the physical hardware and allocate them to a specific role; another step to this goal is to make sure that the servers delegated to the same role are close to the prescribed system state as possible.

In order to help with the second step, we can deploy a centralized package repository. Â However, as time goes on, even if we had a homogeneous system with the same hardware and the same operating system, it's possible for our system to incorporate other pieces of hardware and operating systems that are not equivalent to our original set of servers. Â We want consistent functionality, so we still need to be able to provision these new servers with an appropriate set of packages that provide the same functionality. Â Say we are using RHEL 5.x servers originally, and we're now provisioning servers with FreeBSD 8.x. Â We obviously cannot cleanly use RPM's on FreeBSD (we might be fine if we used the FreeBSD Linux compatible libraries that come with the distribution), nor can we use packages from FreeBSD on Linux (Linux does not come with a FreeBSD compatibility layer.)

We could, however, use <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>. Â The packages that it generates might not be universal for every operating system, but there's a singular pkgsrc tree that compiles the same set of source code. Â I'd imagine that one could provision a system for each OS being deployed (or setup a cross-compile environment for different operating systems on a single system, sort of similar to <a href="http://tinderbox.marcuscom.com/">Tinderbox</a> for FreeBSD.) Â Theoretically, one simply has to set the same package options for each pkgsrc compiled program, and then compile the program and its dependencies for each OS that's deployed (of course, you'd have to make sure that you do a "make package" instead of a straight "make install".) Â Then you could NFS mount the package repository on each server, then do a pkg_add /path/to/packages.

But what about post-install configuration? Â You'd probably have to either fork the pkgsrc tree locally and design new packages that are based on whatever package is already in the original pkgsrc tree, or edit a few files in the pkgsrc tree itself (which can be bad, since you'd probably want to update the pkgsrc tree from CVS, which could wipe out your changes.)

In any case, I haven't found any decent universal binary package manager that works across all Linux distros and other UNIX operating systems, pkgsrc seems to be the closest thing to such a thing (even if you have to compile everything from scratch.)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There has been several efforts to address the issue of ensuring fault tolerance for game servers; one approach is to introduce <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mishras/research/ft_tcp.html">a new protocol based on TCP</a> that has extra checks to ensure fault tolerance.  <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.98.8585&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Another approach</a> is to section off the game world and structure it so that there are several zones, with each zone maintained by a different authority.

However, let's consider FPS game servers: the game players expect low latency for each action that they perform in the server, no noticeable network degradation when they're on one side of the map or another, and they expect the server hardware to not choke when the server is at full capacity.  Further, most FPS game server binaries <em>do not have application level fault tolerance built in</em>.  Therefore, we want to look at the first solution, which is to use a modified TCP protocol on each of the servers that we want to use, and see if we can provide fault tolerance without editing any of the client software nor the server software.

The major challenge (that I can see so far) is the following: we must preserve the game state between all of the participating game servers.  If one server goes down - assuming that our modified protocol migrates everyone perfectly to the backup server - we need to have the backup game server have the entire game environment replicated, so that it doesn't disrupt gameplay.  One way we could possibly do this is to have a machine that handles the TCP connections in front, and multicasts that traffic to both game servers.  Thus, the players are in fact playing on both game servers at the same time.

<a href="http://www.redbluemagenta.com/wp-root/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fig1_gameserver.gif"><img src="http://www.redbluemagenta.com/wp-root/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fig1_gameserver-300x300.gif" alt="" title="Figure 1, &quot;Game Server Fault Tolerance&quot;" width="300" height="300" /></a>

However, we cannot guarantee that the game state is in fact equivalent on both machines; this would be even more troublesome if there was an element of AI in the game, which we can safely assume will do different actions on either server.

Anyway, that's where I'm at right now so far.  I'll have to do a bit more research and see if ST-TCP is a feasible option (I'm also looking at another solution, called <a href="http://userweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/lorenzo/lft.html">FT-TCP</a>.)  Preserving the game state, however, is the biggest obstacle to tackle.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I want everyone to read <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=20693637&postcount=154">this post</a> on NeoGAF and then proceed to read the rest of this post.  The post on NeoGAF is about "university as a business" and the oversaturation of college graduates; it is a startling and quite insightful view on the state of American education, and how we are digging ourselves a grave with our never ending cycle of degree requirements in the industry and the promise of American education to fulfill that end.

One of the symptoms of this problem is a never ending supply of graduates who think that since they have a degree, their options are limitless and that they are part of the educated elite.  Unfortunately, this viewpoint automatically sabotages the person in question: if everyone thinks this and pursues this goal with that viewpoint in mind (and the environment allows for this), then obviously the population of people who have this goal in mind will increase and will become saturated.  However, I believe what's worse than this is that the common mindset is aligned more with the underbelly of marketing than with the ideals of old school University education; this further perpetuates the lowering of the value of today's bachelor's degree.  This is further amplified by the large gap between what the industry requires from graduates, and where the University has traditionally aligned its values.  The University has started to realign its values to match those of the industry, when the whole POINT of a University education is to teach values and subjects that are long lasting and move much slower than the ever changing industry.

This also causes us to reevaluate the true value of education: is it simply a nominal designation of achievement; that is, if we are "educated," is this simply another way of saying, "yes, I went through so and so program," or is it still rooted in a deep appreciation for the subjects that we are studying?  I suppose for some, the latter definition is what they hold true; for many others, the first definition is what they resonate with.  However, I think this problem has existed for quite a while, though I believe this issue has been amplified in today's world.

I've only a few pieces of advice for those who are still early in their academic career, or are considering college in the near future:

<ol>
<li>Don't study something just because it will make you a ton of money.  Study something because you love the subject.  The way you figure this out is to take as many classes as you can in various subjects, until you can't go on any further.  Many people figure out how to make a sufficient amount of money for how they live, no matter their degree.</li>
<li>Study a lot of different subjects.  Don't overspecialize in your undergraduate career, the whole point of an undergraduate education is to be as well-rounded as possible and to learn <em>how to think</em>; specialize in grad school, not in undergrad.</li>
<li>It's not the end of the world if you can't get into your favorite academic program.  Academia isn't the end point of your life.</li>
<li>Develop a deep appreciation of a problem in whatever field you want to get into.</li>
<li>Be humble when applying for jobs.  Just because you have a bachelor's degree, doesn't mean you'll get an awesome job.  This is especially true today, as explained above.  Everyone starts at the bottom.  And no, it's not the end of the world if you start at the bottom, it's only the beginning.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Site: <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">http://projecteuler.net/</a>

I'm not sure if I'm going to publish any more after this, mostly because the whole point of solving the problems on the site is to learn some stuff about math and computer science, and so it'll be to everyone's benefit if I don't publish every solution I find.

Anyway, here's problem #1.  I'll be writing my code in really rough pseudocode:

<blockquote>PROBLEM #1: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</blockquote>

We notice that if we divide evenly into a number <em>n</em> with say an integer <em>k</em>, we end up with no remainder.  So in order to check to see if <em>n</em> is divided evenly by <em>k</em>, we use the modulo operator and see if it's 0.  In this case, we want to check against <em>k</em> = 3 and <em>k</em> = 5.  If we find that <em>n</em> mod <em>k</em> is equal to 0, then we want to store <em>n</em> in a list of numbers that we want to keep for ourselves.

<pre><code>if n mod 3 == 0, then add number to the list of numbers that will be summed up.
if n mod 5 == 0, then add number to the list of numbers that will be summed up.
if n mod 5 != 0 && n mod 3 != 0, then _don't_ add number to the list.</code></pre>

What's wrong with the code above?  We want to make sure that we don't add a number twice to the list if the number is both divided evenly by 3 and 5 (like the number 15.)  We could always just add another if statement that catches the case where 3 and 5 both evenly divide <em>n</em>, but I'm taking another approach: we add an additional variable to the code and tweak our if statement a little bit:

<pre><code>pushToList = 0
if n mod 3 == 0, pushToList = 1.
if n mod 5 == 0, pushToList = 1.
if pushToList == 1, push n to the end of the list.</code></pre>

We embed this in a loop such that the iterator goes from 1 to 999:

<pre><code>for i in (1..999)
pushToList = 0
if i mod 3 == 0, pushToList = 1.
if i mod 5 == 0, pushToList = 1.
if pushToList == 1, push n to the end of the list.
end
</code></pre>

Then we spit out the sum of the list.

<pre><code>for each element in list,
sum += element
end
display "sum"
</code></pre>

Alright, that's done.  Here's problem #2.  This is a little harder, since we have to worry about performance optimization:

<blockquote>PROBLEM #2: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

<center>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</center>

Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not exceed four million.</blockquote>

The Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the last two terms in the sequence, with the first two terms set to 1.  In the example above, the author decides to start with 1 and 2, but we can stick with the usual definition, where <em>F</em>(1) = 1, <em>F</em>(2) = 1, and <em>F</em>(n) = <em>F</em>(n - 1) + <em>F</em>(n - 2).

Our main body of the code should look something like this:

<pre><code>while fibTemp < 4000000
fibTemp = F(i)
if (F(i) mod 2 == 0), push F(i) to the list of numbers to be added
end

F(n) {
if n <= 2, return 1
return F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)
}</code></pre>

However, this is extremely inefficient.  Look at <em>F</em>(5) = <em>F</em>(4) + <em>F</em>(3): <em>F</em>(4) is also equal to <em>F</em>(3) + <em>F</em>(2), and once we're done calculating <em>F</em>(4), we've already calculated <em>F</em>(3), but we have to recalculate <em>F</em>(3) on the other side of the recursive equation anyway.

Since I'm a lazy bastard, I pulled up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">Wikipedia page for the Fibonacci Sequence</a>, and observed that we can express the <em>n</em>th term of the sequence in the following form:

<center>[latex]\left( \begin{array}{cc}1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{array} \right)^{n-1} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}F_n & F_{n-1} \\ F_{n-1} & F_{n-2} \end{array} \right)[/latex]</center>

Therefore, if we iterated the first matrix <em>n - 1</em> times, then we can read off the <em>n</em>th term in the (0,0)th spot in the resulting matrix.

Can we do better than this?  We notice that when we calculate the <em>n</em>th term in the Fibonacci sequence, we have to multiply the matrix <em>n - 1</em> times; this means that for the <em>n+1</em>th term, we redo our multiplication <em>n - 1</em> times, times another matrix; this results in wasted CPU cycles.  And so, instead of using a built in function to calculate an arbitrary exponentiation of a matrix, we'd want to store the last matrix calculated and then multiply that with the first matrix.

<pre><code>M = ( (1, 1), (1, 0) )
cachedMatrix = M
sum = 0

while (cachedMatrix.coordinate(0,0) < 4000000)
cachedMatrix *= M
array.push cachedMatrix.coordinate(0,0) if cachedMatrix.coordinate(0,0) mod 2 == 0
end

for each element in array
sum += array[element]
end

display "sum"</code></pre>

I'm sure there's a faster solution than that which only uses integer scalars in a loop (a friend of mine, Paul Wallstrom, has a decent solution as well); however, this should solve #2 as well.]]></content:encoded>

<li><em>Infinite Jest</em> by David Foster Wallace</li>
<li><em>A First Course in Probability</em> by Sheldon Ross (why oh why didn't I take any statistics/probability courses in college?)</li>
<li><em>War and Peace</em> by Leo Tolstoy (I've read through roughly 2/3rds of the book in the past)</li>

<li><em>Crime and Punishment</em> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</li>
<li><em>Frankenstein</em> by Mary Shelley (I've read through this twice before)</li>
<li><em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em> by Philip K. Dick</li>
<li><em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> by Immanuel Kant (I've only read selections of his philosophical writings, and was taught from secondary sources about his overall position.)</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(<a href="http://www.redbluemagenta.com/index.php/2009/12/08/life-as-a-junior-sysadmin-part-i/">Here's the link to Part I.</a>)

It's been roughly a year since I've been out of school and have worked as a junior sysadmin for roughly that long as well; in terms of sysadmin-esque experience, I've worked at a research lab, at a high school, and now at a managed web hosting company, and have learned a lot within this short span of time.  My current position has especially taught me a lot in how to do things in a large site that has to run 24x7; for instance, there has to be a lot of caution on which servers to deal with, as one could be either the main load balancer, or it could just be a load balanced slave machine.  And if things must be done on a host that's a single point of failure, then there ALWAYS ALWAYS must be a back out plan.

As an example, I had to check log files that were spread out among 50 different web servers.  In small sites (< 20 servers), we could just do it manually and it'd be fine.  However, with 50 web servers, each generating gigabytes worth of log files spread out among hundreds of log files per server, things have to be automated with a simple shell script.  So I wrote out a script that did a grep on each server for each log file, but while testing the script on a small subset of servers, I ended up killing the I/O on the entire subset of machines.  Not good.  So I had to make sure that if I did have to kill the I/O on each server, it'd have to only hit one server at a time, so that only one server is essentially "out of rotation" at any given time; this is much better than taking down the entire set of web servers, which would significantly impact our web service (thankfully those 50 servers are a subset of all of the web servers, but it'd still take a significant chunk out of our web service.)

The one thing so far that I know I have to brush up on is computer science and programming; I didn't have a complete computer science education in college (I did two years of CS in Seattle University but was totally sick of the software engineering bent that they took), so I'm completely ignorant of a ton of things, like basic data structures other than a hash map and a binary tree, and I also am pretty ignorant about the common algorithms usually used when solving CS problems.  I'm currently learning both Ruby and Perl (I've programmed a bit in Perl for the high school gig, but not too much), and I should probably learn Python while I'm at it as well.  So far, most of the things I've written were in shell scripts, which, for most of the tasks I needed to solve and automate, are probably sufficient enough.  However, I'm likely going to run against a problem which requires much more power than what I can come up with in a shell script, and so I figure I have to be a little more proactive about it.

Thankfully I haven't been put in the on-call rotation yet, so I've no idea what would be involved (though I have had to babysit some stuff in previous jobs late at night, though it wasn't anything like getting called at 2 AM in order to fix a downed server.)

My last few jobs had let me build a few things for the infrastructure, though nowadays, I'm mostly in maintenance mode; I should probably draft up a few pet projects to do for my job, and see if they'll get approved.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The one lesson that I've carried with me from my formal philosophy education was that I ought to question many belief systems, including my own.  And to be honest, I have done a lot of questioning of my own beliefs throughout college, up to today.

For instance, to seed the discussion a little bit, I've often asked myself this question: have I lead a false life up to this point?  We could look toward the existentialists for some inspiration on a possible answer: our life is simply a bundle of experiences that we shape ourselves, and so any life that we live isn't necessarily "false" (with this particular philosophy, I'd say that it'd be erroneous to predicate something like "our lives" with the words "true" or "false"; we simply live our lives, and that's that.)  But maybe, at least for some of us, since there's a nagging feeling in our heads about whether we did the right or wrong thing, that we can indeed talk about the "true" or "false" life, but in the context of morality; but what exactly is morality?  The Q&A cycle goes on and on from this point.

So the process is quite relentless and almost never ending (maybe when we tire of debating ourselves and others about various topics, we start drawing lines and say that, yes, <em>this</em> is exactly where my foundational beliefs are.)  But we question those as well, and see if we can get even further down and see if we were erroneous to even believe that our current belief system is even an accurate one.

Some of you might say, "of course we can establish a stance!"  But it seems to always be for the sake of debate, rather than for establishing a source of inspiration on how to view the world.  In light of that, how do we establish such a foundational stance that would last us for our entire lives?  Perhaps the answer does come from the gut, though sometimes, our gut is influenced by what goes on around us, which is further contingent on other factors in the past.  Perhaps we really should just bite the bullet and accept that any particular philosophy is okay, as long as he products of any actions produced by said philosophy are "useful" in some sense.

But really, I don't really have an answer at this time, but I have an inkling that the answer would generally come from continental philosophy; analytic philosophy has sort of showed me how to systematically tear apart arguments, but it seems to not do much in establishing any guidance on how one ought to live life.   ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After wrestling a little bit with Debian package creation at my job, I've realized a few things, mostly in terms of the sort of abstractions that one have to take into consideration before diving head first into creating packages:

<ol>
	<li><strong>Every package that is listed is in a tree of dependencies (either as a dependency, a parent of a dependency, etc.) must have an empty set of files in the entire dependency tree's intersection.</strong> Of course, we can curtail this by listing certain packages in the "Conflicts" section of the Debian package control file as well as doing fancy post installation manipulation with the "postinst" script, but in general, you'll have to make sure that there are no other folders or files that are listed multiple times in other packages that are in the dependency tree.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have had an iPad for the past two weeks, and I've mostly broken it in with apps and finger smudges that I just don't care to clean anymore.  I have been using my iPad almost exclusively when I'm outside of my apartment, just to see how it would fare against my Macbook Pro when I'm doing actual work.  Anyway, I haven't owned an iPhone and I was largely against Apple's walled garden for many years, before finally succumbing to all of the marketing and the lackluster performance and absence of apps on my N900.

I would like to say that I'm pleased with my purchase; the interface is a good choice for tablets in general, and I would love to see more devices that actually pay close attention to the form factor when designing the UI for the operating system.  However, there are quite a few annoyances when it comes to using the iPad regularly:

<ol>
<li>iSSH works great, but only if you don't like using the arrow keys, ctrl, alt, and esc in your hardware keyboard.  This nearly makes the iPad a no-go for systems administrators, though iSSH does include ctrl, esc, and tab on the top bar as software buttons.  Not being able to use arrows keys makes things quite annoying however, especially when you're trying to save keystrokes by invoking a command in the command history.  Apparently, this is a bug that cannot be fixed by the iSSH developers: Apple must release a fixed SDK.</li>
<li>Running concurrent

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most of the stuff I write is typically in an imperative programming language; I usually don't stray much further than, say, shell scripting, Perl, or Ruby.  However, I'd love to learn a language that's just way outside of what I'm comfortable with: one way I could do this is to learn a functional programming language.  I'm thinking about starting with Erlang, but Haskell might be a good candidate as well.

I think the <a href="http://zotonic.com">Zotonic project</a> might be a great place to start in order to learn Erlang.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, before I interviewed with <a href="http://www.jambool.com">Jambool</a>, I interviewed with <a href="http://www.3tier.com">3TIER</a>, who provides information services for alternative energy companies.  I've heard from them just recently, and they've offered me a permanent full time position.

This fits well with the timing of the end of my contract: Jambool is an <em>excellent</em> place to work at, and I've learned a lot from my boss, <a href="http://entropystream.net">Benjamin Krueger</a>, and have had a great time in a great environment (I would go as far to say that I'm honored to have worked with such talent; they are, without a doubt, some of the best people in the industry.)

Cheers, Jambool: I wish you guys well in your venture.

However, I also couldn't pass on a great opportunity to work as a part of an industry that aims to provide solid alternatives to big oil, especially with what's going on these days in the Gulf of Mexico.  Further, I'll again have an opportunity to administer high performance compute clusters, something that I enjoyed administering back at the University of Washington.

Again, I had a great time at Jambool and I knew, after working there for a month, that I'd really enjoy working there for quite a long time.

It was a tough decision, and unfortunately, the decision came down to simple economics: do I want medical benefits and a stable income, or should I rely solely on contract work?  I suppose it depends from person to person, but for me, at this point in time, I need stable, full-time employment so I can pay off these damned student loans as fast as possible.

Anyway, I'm thinking that once I gain more experience and get my student loans mostly paid off, I can venture back into startup world and see what the waters look like once I'm ready to jump back in. :)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've started to use <a href="http://puppetlabs.com">Puppet</a> at my current job, which is a configuration management system for UNIX operating systems, including Linux, *BSD, Solaris, and Mac OS X (Windows support is coming soon according to Reductive Labs: though GPO's are nice, the programmatic interface of Puppet easily trumps GPO's, since you can't really extend GPO's beyond whatever interfaces Microsoft provides out of the box.)

After working with systems that are maintained with custom scripts and with a lot of customizations on each box, it seems obvious to me that Puppet is the way to go.  It's a common "infrastructure language" that you can communicate in with everyone else, which makes it easy to share how one implements a piece of software in a given system.  Also, the language is a declarative specification that describes what the state of your infrastructure <em>should</em> look like, rather than writing procedural code that will, more likely than not, only work in one given site with a specific set of systems.  A declarative language also helps in keeping systems within a consistent state; if any change is seen at all that does not match up with the specification, Puppet swoops in and makes sure that the machine is consistent with the specification.  This is another thing too: the Puppet client can be safely run multiple times without it changing anything underneath your feet, unless there's any changes that aren't in sync with the central specification.

Puppet communicates to the master server in XML-RPC over HTTP with YAML formatted data; in the future, this will all be converted to a RESTful style of transport.  It's coded in Ruby, so that means we'd either have to use WEBRick (ew), Mongrel, or Passenger.

How does Puppet handle different systems and architectures?  More often than not, we use another program that Puppet depends on called "facter," which is a Ruby program that grabs the various "facts" about a particular system and stores them in variables that Puppet can then refer to.  For instance, if say we wanted to install apache2 on CentOS and Debian systems, we would write this bit of code in Puppet in order to catch all of the possible package names:

<pre><code>$apachepkg = case $operatingsystem {
        debian => 'apache2',
        centos => 'httpd',
        default => undef
}</code></pre>

<em>(Note: $operatingsystem is a global variable that is pulled in from facter.  If we had any other variables that we wanted to assign through facter in the future, we can easily do that.)</em>

Thus, if Puppet sees that the operating system is Debian, the case statement will assign the value "apache2" to $apachepkg, "httpd" if it's CentOS, or will "undefine" the variable if it's anything else.  Puppet has hooks for many operating systems and distributions, so you won't have to worry too much about figuring out whether to use <code>uname -a</code>, <code>lsb-release</code>, or whatever other tool on whatever operating system in order to figure out this bit of information for a particular host (I'm writing this right now on a Mac OS X machine, and running <code>uname -a</code> on my machine gives an output that could possibly be misconstrued as describing a barebones Darwin host; in practice, this will likely not be the case, but imagine if you had to deal with these sorts of corner cases in a shell script . . . )

There's a few caveats to Puppet, however:

<ol>
<li>To my knowledge, Puppet's language is not Turing complete.  This might not seem like a huge deal at first, but there's a lot of ugly bootstrapping that a specification can take on that will become unmaintainable and will end up undermining the idempotent nature of the language; there's in fact a type in Puppet called "exec" that allows you to execute arbitrary commands on a Puppet managed box, and this is often used to quickly manage pieces of the infrastructure that is typically not managed by Puppet (extracting tarballs and moving stuff around, for instance.)  An example of this that I ran into was creating a Puppet specification for a wiki.  The OS packages wouldn't cut it, and I was running against a deadline, so I had to grab a package straight from the upstream provider's website, write some code in Puppet with the exec type in order to extract and move the contents of the tarball in place, and <em>make sure it only happens once</em> under specific conditions.  The italics are placed there to show how kludgy the whole thing can become; instead of writing a specification describing the system, we're instead trying to write procedural code in a limited domain specific language.</li>
<li>For now, Puppet doesn't scale too well; I imagine this will be much better once Puppet migrates over to a RESTful transport.  We can mitigate this by running Mongrel or Passenger for our web server, but currently, the Puppet Master (yes, that's what it's called; the daemon is named puppetmasterd) has to load everything into memory before pushing specifications to the clients.  This is terrible in a number of ways: what if we were to push a large file down the pipe?  The server has to load the <em>entire file</em> into memory, which will likely lead to issues.  We can mitigate this by either creating an exec type that executes <code>curl</code> or <code>wget</code> in order to pull down the file from a central file store, or by creating an OS specific package in our repository.  But even this can get kludgy, since not everything really translates well to being packaged as an .rpm or a .deb package (I could imagine a SQL dump or some sort of large schema needing to be managed by Puppet.)</li>
</ol>

Otherwise, for most deployments, Puppet is an excellent tool to use as a way to ease most administrative tasks.  It's much better and easier to manage than a repository of scripts, and it's easy to share your work with other sysadmins.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This might sound bizarre to a lot of people who are in IT; after all, our primary job title dictates what our primary goals are.  A DBA makes sure that the databases are up and running, a systems administrator makes sure that the systems are up and running, and a security engineer makes sure that the systems are running as securely as possible, and that the processes in a company involving computing services keep IT security in mind.

But we often forget <em>why</em> we're doing what we're doing.  Yes, the systems must be up and running and everything has to be well oiled, but we do not do it for the sake of doing it, but we do it because we have customers who require computing services to be up and running.  Not only that, but we have a greater responsibility in the community to make sure that we're providing a computing environment that lets people get their work done.

Of course, there's mandates and various things we would have to comply with: for instance, if we work in any health related industry, we'd have to comply with HIPAA.  But otherwise, why put the users through all sorts of hoops?

Some IT admins might have a tendency to lock down the computers as much as possible and only allow certain programs to be installed.  I say, give them admin access to their computers and allow your infrastructure to be flexible and not rigid (that is, you'd have to account for any environmental factors in your infrastructure, rather than shield everything away from the environment.)  This may mean more work for you to block against any sort of foreign agent (viruses, spyware, etc.), but ultimately, it would be for the user's benefit.  I'd say that if you force yourself to think in these parameters, you'll start thinking about solutions that are as transparant as possible to the user, which is a huge net win for the users and for you.

Too many times have I seen deployments where the computers are as locked down as possible from any sort of user intervention; it was impossible for anyone to get anything done, and it was impossible for anyone to "personalize" their computer in any sort of way.  "They should do that on their home machine," you might say.  But you might also be directly responsible for any sort of ill will against your department and maybe even for overall morale in the company . . .]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When an organization says outright that they only hire smart people, I'd love to believe that they're telling the truth (they might actually believe this to be true.)  However, I've found out that an organization must put its money where its mouth is when it comes to actually <em>keeping</em> them on staff.

<h3>1. Smart people want to be recognized, not necessarily with money.</h3>

More often than not in <em>company-that-shall-not-be-named</em>, whenever someone did <em>anything</em> remotely beneficial, the managers would not recognize how much effort and time was sunk into that specific problem.  Yes, there is a lot of satisfaction from solving technical problems, but I believe that actually <em>knowing</em> that you've done a decent job goes a long way.  In fact, in this same company, the joke was that there was only a "once a year praise quota."  This is bad.

They tried to make up for this by giving healthy amount of bonuses at the end of the year, along with opportunities to earn money if one goes to company outings.  I don't know about you, but I don't buy my friends, and I don't especially care about bonuses; I care more about making friends outside of any monetary incentive and how invested I am in the work I do.

<h3>2. The workload must not make the person feel like Sisyphus.  Corollary: there must be a drive in the organization to actually improve the workload.</h3>

In the same company, there was almost no encouragement nor opportunity to actually get rid of the interrupt driven tickets.  Any sort of improvement in the infrastructure was only dealt with by the managers, and so the rest of us would have to only deal with the same tickets, day after day.  After three months, I only started to actually understand the infrastructure, to which I suggested that I take on a major project to get a working installation of Puppet up and running: this idea was killed on the spot.

<h3>3. Smart people need direction, too.</h3>

There's no way for anyone to figure out what's going on by themselves, when they have to not only figure out how the infrastructure is strung together, but also figure out the institutional memory behind the infrastructure as well.  When given no direction, there's no way anyone's going to figure out both aspects of the infrastructure within a given time frame, unless you give them a project that gives both direction and an opportunity to ask pointed questions about the infrastructure.

<h3>4. Communication is great (in moderation.)</h3>

At <em>the-company-that-shall-not-be-named</em>, there was almost no communication: everyone was left to their own devices, lots of work was duplicated, and when there was any sort of communication, it was all about showing how much more ego one has over the other person.

At another company, there was <em>too much</em> communication, to the point where anything must be vetted by committee, thus creating an environment that stymied any sort of initiative.

I believe the best middle ground is having a workflow based off of the Agile approach: there's a quick ten minute meeting every week where everyone reports on what they're working on and how far they've gotten, and everything is sketched out based on two/three week sprints.

But most importantly, I believe maintaining professional respect for the other party is important; let all parties know what's going on, no matter how good or bad the news is.  The Agile methodology is not necessarily the cure-all for all of your ills.

Anyway, that's all I have to say about the topic.  I wish said company well, but they have a long ways to go toward actually retaining their supposed talent.  I hope that if you're running a business, that you try not to fall into the same trap as <em>the-company-that-shall-not-be-named</em>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The value of documentation and formal processes rears its ugly head right when we forget what we did six months ago, and when we have to pass knowledge over to any other person in the company.

They seem to have no value otherwise, especially if "everyone knows" that a process has always been done a certain way in the company, or when you're the only person in the department who has to do a certain function that no one else does.  Unfortunately, a process might seem intuitive to one person, but for the next person who will either assist or replace you, it will not be intuitive at all for them (they would have to figure out what you take for granted.  This would not be easy to uncover.)  In fact, I'd wager that said process will become unintuitive for <em>you</em> in six months, granted that you end up moving on to other projects or other roles.

The biggest warning sign that should hint toward creating an up to date documentation store is if you have to go to a specific person for a specific piece of information that is needed for <em>you</em> to get things done.  Information within an organization should, for the most part, be documented, which serves two purposes: 1. to cover your ass, and 2. to make sure that if anyone else needs to do what you used to do, then they can do it (think of it this way: you can also move on to bigger and better projects without having to remember a bunch of things about other projects.  But as I hinted at in the last blog post, do your other coworkers a favor and automate the things you've just documented, or have them automate it for you.)

Further, having a well documented process that everyone follows will both make sure that the process is done consistently, and will allow you to automate the procedure once it's written down and well understood.

Lastly, having a ton of documentation is not just for big, lumbering enterprises.  In fact, it's likely you'll be wearing many hats at a smaller organization, and it's crucial that you're able to reproduce your work consistently when you're doing one task in a specific role, and then switch over to another role and do another task consistently as well.  So write down everything that you've done for a project, write down the steps while troubleshooting various issues in deployment and maintenance, and after you're done writing these things down, try to write automated tasks so that you don't have to worry about doing those things that you've just written down (if the automation breaks, you'll know where it breaks down since you've written out how to fix the service manually . . . right?)]]></content:encoded>

<ol>
<li>Read through at least one book in my <a href="/2010/05/11/reading-wishlist-or-what-i-would-read-if-i-didnt-dedicate-so-much-of-my-time-to-video-games/">reading list</a>. (~ within 2 months)</li>
<li>Hack a bit more on <a href="http://enkiblog.com">Enki</a>; what I need to do is separate out the archives a bit more so that they are divided by months and years. (ongoing)</li>
<li>Learn Python. (over the next two weeks)</li>
<li><a href="/2010/06/03/goal-for-the-next-few-months-learn-a-functional-programming-language/">Learn a functional programming language</a>. (~ three months or so)</li>
<li>Get Passenger and Rails setup on my <a href="http://prgmr.com">prgmr</a> VPS.  I've recently upgraded the amount of RAM on my VPS, now I just need to use it effectively.  This is also for getting Enki up and running. (as soon as (2) is mostly done)</li>
<li>Completely replace Wordpress with Enki.  Enki is already shaping up to be a dream to hack on, whereas I can't even imagine myself hacking on Wordpress. (as soon as I get Passenger + Rails up and running)</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>(EDIT: Credit for part of the show method goes to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2726525/group-and-sort-blog-posts-by-date-in-rails">Senthil on Stack Overflow</a>.)</em>

I've finally gotten monthly archives to work in <a href="http://enkiblog.com">Enki</a>, which is a minimalist blog engine built on top of Rails; you can most likely follow these directions with whatever Rails blogging app that you have built from scratch.

Basically, how this works is that when the user visits /archives/:year, all of the posts are enumerated for that specific year; if the user visits /archives/:year/:month, all of the posts for that specific month are shown; and finally, if the user visits /archives/:year/:month/:day, all of the posts for that specific day are shown.

First of all, in Enki, there's a separate Archives controller and route already created for you; instead of breaking convention, I've decided to extend the controller by adding the magic in the "show" method of the controller.  Further, I've decided to use the by_star gem, in order to easily collect posts by year, by month, and by day.

Before doing this, be sure to install the by_star gem:

<pre><code>gem install by_star</code></pre>

Here's what the controller looks like:

<pre>
<code>class ArchivesController < ApplicationController
...
def show
    year = params[:year]
    month = params[:month]
    day = params[:day]
    
    if (year && month && day)
      @entries = Post.by_day(Time.local(year, month, day)).reverse
    elsif (year && month && !day)
      @entries = Post.by_month(Time.local(year, month)).reverse
    else
      @entries = Post.by_year(year).reverse
    end
  end
end</code>
</pre>

Here's what my routes.rb file looks like:

<pre>
<code>...
  map.archives '/archives', :controller => 'archives', :action => 'index'
  map.connect '/archives/:year/:month/:day', :controller => 'archives', :action => 'show'
  map.connect '/archives/:year/:month', :controller => 'archives', :action => 'show'
  map.connect '/archives/:year', :controller => 'archives', :action => 'show'</code>
</pre>

The next thing I'm working on is the page that's displayed when the user visits /archives/; the page should only display the years that actually have posts, and after the user clicks the year, it'll drop down a list of months that have posts.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>(Inspired from the <a href="http://dev2ops.org/blog/2010/3/22/criteria-for-fully-automated-provisioning.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+Dev2ops+(dev2opsATOM)">dev2ops post</a> on the same subject.)</em>

I am extremely interested in the "DevOps" movement, if not for the methodologies it purports to fulfill.  The ideas aren't necessarily new; there's a lot of literature - typically published on <a href="http://usenix.org">USENIX</a> - on new methods of looking at infrastructure provisioning and maintenance.  However, the DevOps movement is probably the largest movement that aims to actually implement these ideas in web operations (and hopefully the reach of the movement will penetrate other markets as well.)  One of the ideas that is highly appealing to me, and I presume for many other systems administrators as well, is the idea that the infrastructure should be completely automated and abstract enough for us to operate on the systems without touching any one of them directly.  Having a fully automated infrastructure allows us to treat each box in the system as simply a commodity, and not as a unique box with special customizations on it.

As soon as we have an infrastructure where we only worry about service levels, and not about any particular box being up or down (because we can just reprovision the box to take up another role), we can start adding more layers that start changing how we view our systems.  Instead of worrying whether httpd is running on a-box-009.prod, we instead look at metrics that infer, "hits per second have gone down from 100/s to 20/s."  We observe trends in our data and provision more boxes as necessary, instead of having to tweak one special box for one special set of hardware in order to squeeze performance out of it (hardware is cheap, labor is not.)  If we do any sort of performance tuning, we only do it once on a single box of a certain class, to which we bake the configuration into our specification and roll it out to all of the other servers (where said class is what we specify as a grouping of servers: small EC2 instances could belong in a single class, whereas medium EC2 instances can belong in another class.  Probably even better is to classify servers by role AND by hardware specs.)

We should recognize that hardware is cheap, and that we should be able to reproduce everything we do.  It's not enough to set it up on one box and call it good: if we can't roll out the configuration to many boxes along with monitoring and metrics within a much tighter time frame, we aren't finished with our job of rolling out the service.  We do this by using <a href="http://puppetlabs.com">Puppet</a> or some other configuration management system; adding a new package in Puppet should entail adding a declaration that adds Nagios and Munin/Cacti/etc. monitoring for that package as well.

Though our unique knack for figuring out core problems by just looking at how a system behaves is still useful in this new view of systems administration, we should strive to take our craft and mold it into a profession that has more of an engineering/architectural bent to it.  Instead of sniffing around and using our intuition for solving issues, we should be able to abstract enough of our craft away from solving individual issues and start looking at systems in a more holistic way.  This new view, something that DevOps aims to bring to fruition, will help us build scalable systems quickly and reliably, and will free up our time to tackle larger projects and to listen more to customer concerns.]]></content:encoded>
