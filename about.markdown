I currently work for [3TIER] [1] as a systems administrator. I also administer
an OpenBSD router for [Cafe Allegro] [2] with two other volunteer sysadmins. I
design a few websites as a hobby with XHTML and CSS, and I occasionally
volunteer my time for various nonprofit and academic organizations, such as
[The Critical Gaming Project] [3] and [Noise for the Needy] [4]. I also
program in Ruby as a hobby, and more often than not, they are usually apps
on Ruby on Rails.

I currently live in my hometown, Seattle, WA. I live with my girlfriend, Sara;
her dog, Riley; and my cat, Eve.

This site is a place where I write about my professional work and a few other
topics that are of personal interest. I’m still new to the field, though I
hope to contribute a few technical articles here and there for those who are
looking for a little bit of help.

About this site
---------------

redbluemagenta is a blog generated with [Jekyll] [8] on a Debian Lenny
[prgmr.com] [9] virtual slice. The design and code for the website theme was
all done in vim and TextMate with a pinch of Photoshop here and there. For the
entire development cycle, I’ve used git for source control and sharing source
code between multiple machines. I’ve employed @font-face on two fonts on this
site for a consistent viewing experience.

I might be sharing my work as a BSD licensed theme, but there’s a lot of extra
work involved in removing any site-specific customizations from my particular
theme installation.
