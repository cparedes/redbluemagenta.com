Anyone who has just graduated from college ought to continue live like how they
lived for the past couple of years.  Cool, you have a new job and you finally
have an income - continue eating top ramen.  After doing this, you can save
a ton of money and throw it either into your savings for rainy days, or
throw it all into your student loans so you can be rid of the ever looming
debt over your head.  In fact, I suggest that you put much of your money into
your student loans for the first couple of years out of college and not give
into buying new crap; if you do this, you can expect to pay off your loans
within two or three years.

I'm trying to do this myself.  I've finally got my spending down to just food
and bills; I then threw $1000 toward Sallie Mae and I plan on doing this
for the next few months.  If I keep this up, this means I get to pay off my
Sallie Mae debt in roughly a year.
