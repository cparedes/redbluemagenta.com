I've accepted a position as a contract junior systems administrator at <a href="http://www.jambool.com/">Jambool, Inc.</a>  My short tenure at Accretive was illuminating to say the least; I learned a lot about various aspects of systems administration at a large site.

I'm thirsting to see what a startup can offer in terms of the type of environment it offers: I'll be working with a lot of smart people and will be working in a very lean environment.  I can't wait for my first day. :)
