Instead of flooding people with a bunch of links to various bands/songs I've recently started getting into, I'll just post them in a single blog post and people can choose to pick over them if they wish.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/tVgqDh0gz_U">The Go Team: My Head Hurts (From Archer Come Sparrow)</a>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/MGtAJH53ZGA">No Age: Dead Plane (live) (From Weirdo Rippers)</a>
