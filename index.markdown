blurb: Ian is a SAGE Level II System Administrator.

I'm a junior systems administrator working mostly with BSD and Linux systems,
especially with Debian, CentOS/RHEL, and OpenBSD.  I'm a member of [SAGE] [1]
and [LOPSA] [2].

Also, you might be wondering what "SAGE Level II" means: [here's a list of
job descriptions from SAGE] [3].

Specializations
---------------

I specialize in HPC administration and web services.  I've also fallen in love
recently with modern configuration management tools, such as Puppet and other
various tools.

Current Interests in Systems Administration
-------------------------------------------

I’m currently interested in investigating more into self-healing networks and
systems; while configuration management tools such as Puppet help to achieve
this goal, what if there was an increased demand in a service that "wounds"
the system in a way that usually requires manual intervention? What we’d
usually do is provision more systems and designate them in Puppet as specific
servers; however, can we automate this step so that our tool of choice (or
some other new tool) can auto-provision systems when there’s an increased load
on our service? (I’d imagine that it’d require monitoring of specific metrics,
along with a language that describes what the system should do in order to
ease the load requirements; I could at least imagine a scenario when such a
self-healing system for, say, a web service, can throw too many slave servers
underneath a load balancer, or provision one too many load balancers for the
amount of slave hosts.)

About Ian Paredes
-----------------

I currently work for [3TIER] [4] as a systems administrator. I also administer
an OpenBSD router for Cafe Allegro with two other volunteer sysadmins. I
design a few websites as a hobby with XHTML and CSS, and I occasionally
volunteer my time for various nonprofit and academic organizations, such as
[The Critical Gaming Project] [5] and [Noise for the Needy] [6]. I also
program in Ruby as a hobby, and more often than not, they are usually apps
on Ruby on Rails.
