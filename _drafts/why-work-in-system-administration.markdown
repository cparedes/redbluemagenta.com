title: Why work in system administration?

I will admit right away: system administration is really not a sexy field
to be in, at least compared to the other technology fields out there.
However, I personally feel quite at home in system administration, and based
on my limited exposure so far, it can also be one of the most fulfilling fields
to work in.

The range of responsibilities may vary between teams and different companies,
but at its core, we manage multiple machines, whether they be hooked into a
network or not. Some departments employ sysadmins in order to not only look
over the network and systems of computers, but also to administer any other
device that hooks into a computing device, like a network printer, fax
machines, etc.  Other roles are far removed from the actual physical hardware,
to which the sysadmin takes more on a role of ensuring that such systems
of computers are actually doing what they're supposed to do (which is to
serve that website you always go to, or to let you login with your username
and password without compromising security, etc.)

But why work as a system administrator rather than as a software developer,
or as a lawyer, doctor, etc.?

The biggest reason that the field appeals to me is that I get to solve
interesting problems, day after day; it's awesome to solve issues involving
hundreds, or even thousands, of computers. It's a natural extension of the
knack that one gains when they're fixing a single computer - now
that you're working with hundreds/thousands of machines, you now have to think
about picking a solution that is tractable to deploy to a whole system of
computers.
